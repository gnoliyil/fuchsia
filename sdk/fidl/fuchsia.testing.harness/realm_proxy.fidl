/// This protocol mediates a test suite's access to a component under test.
///
/// A RealmProxy is a test harness which allows some test suite to create instances
/// of the component(s) under test on demand. Most importantly, the test suite
/// does not have to know which components are created or how they are created;
/// It is only required to know which capabilities the components expose.
///
/// For example, a generic test suite for Fuchsia filesystems can use the RealmProxy
/// protocol to spawn components that serve protocols from the fuchsia.io FIDL
/// library. The test suite doesn't need to know which filesystem it's testing
/// or how the filesystem is initialized. It just needs to call
/// [ConnectToNamedProtocol] with the name of a fuchsia.io protocol and start
/// testing. By running this test suite with different proxies that initialize
/// different filesystems, we can use the same suite to validate each system.
