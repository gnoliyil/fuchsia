/// instance configured with a particular system image, init task, etc.

/// For example, the `bionic` galaxy runs components in a bionic (Android libc) based
/// environment.

/// Some methods allow clients to specify the name of a galaxy explicitly, while others rely on the
/// `runner` field of a provided component's `.cml`.
