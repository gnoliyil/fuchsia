/// A ring buffer of audio data.
///
/// Each ring buffer has a producer (who writes to the buffer) and a consumer
/// (who reads from the buffer). Additionally, each ring buffer is associated
/// with a reference clock that keeps time for the buffer.
///
/// ## PCM Data
///
/// A ring buffer of PCM audio is a window into a potentially-infinite sequence
/// of frames. Each frame is assigned a "frame number" where the first frame in
/// the infinite sequence is numbered 0. Frame `X` can be found at ring buffer
/// offset `(X % RingBufferFrames) * BytesPerFrame`, where `RingBufferFrames` is
/// the size of the ring buffer in frames and `BytesPerFrame` is the size of a
/// single frame.
///
/// ## Concurrency Protocol
///
/// Each ring buffer has a single producer and a single consumer which are
/// synchronized by time. At each point in time T according to the ring buffer's
/// reference clock, we define two functions:
///
///   * `SafeWritePos(T)` is the lowest (oldest) frame number the producer is
///     allowed to write. The producer can write to this frame or to any
///     higher-numbered frame.
///
///   * `SafeReadPos(T)` is the highest (youngest) frame number the consumer is
///     allowed to read. The consumer can read this frame or any lower-numbered
///     frame.
///
/// To prevent conflicts, we define these to be offset by one:
///
/// ```
/// SafeWritePos(T) = SafeReadPos(T) + 1
/// ```
///
/// To avoid races, there must be a single producer, but there may be multiple
/// consumers. Additionally, since the producer and consumer(s) are synchronized
/// by *time*, we require explicit fences to ensure cache coherency: the
/// producer must insert an appropriate fence after each write (to flush CPU
/// caches and prevent compiler reordering of stores) and the consumer(s) must
/// insert an appropriate fence before each read (to invalidate CPU caches and
/// prevent compiler reordering of loads).
///
/// Since the buffer has finite size, the producer/consumer cannot write/read
/// infinitely in the future/past. We allocate `P` frames to the producer and
/// `C` frames to the consumer(s), where `P + C <= RingBufferFrames` and `P` and
/// `C` are both chosen by whoever creates the ring buffer.
///
/// ## Deciding on `P` and `C`
///
/// In practice, producers/consumers typically write/read batches of frames
/// on regular periods. For example, a producer might wake every `Dp`
/// milliseconds to write `Dp*FrameRate` frames, where `FrameRate` is the PCM
/// stream's frame rate. If a producer wakes at time T, it will spend up to the
/// next `Dp` period writing those frames. This means the lowest frame number it
/// can safely write to is `SafeWritePos(T+Dp)`, which is equivalent to
/// `SafeWritePos(T) + Dp*FrameRate`. The producer writes `Dp*FrameRate` frames
/// from the position onwards. This entire region, from `SafeWritePos(T)`
/// through `2*Dp*FrameRate` must be allocated to the producer at time T. Making
/// a similar argument for consumers, we arrive at the following constraints:
///
/// ```
/// P >= 2*Dp*FrameRate
/// C >= 2*Dc*FrameRate
/// RingBufferFrames >= P + C
/// ```
///
/// Hence, in practice, `P` and `C` can be derived from the batch sizes used by
/// the producer and consumer, where the maximum batch sizes are limited by the
/// ring buffer size.
///
/// ## Defining `SafeWritePos`
///
/// The definition of `SafeWritePos` (and, implicitly, `SafeReadPos`) must be
/// provided out-of-band.
///
/// ## Non-PCM Data
///
/// Non-PCM data is handled similarly to PCM data, except positions are
/// expressed as "byte offsets" instead of "frame numbers", where the infinite
/// sequence starts at byte offset 0.
