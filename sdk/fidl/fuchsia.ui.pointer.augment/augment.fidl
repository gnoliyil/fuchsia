/// These augmentation protocols represent powerful introspection capabilities
/// into the view hierarchy, and must be individually routed to specific target
/// components. Most clients should not have access to these protocols. Some
/// commonalities:
/// - Theory of operation. These augmentation protocols accept a standard
///   protocol endpoint and return an augmented protocol endpoint. In case of
///   error, the original endpoint is returned.
/// - View hierarchy scope. The reach of the augmented protocols are inherently
///   bound to the original protocols they augment. That is, if the original
///   protocol has power over only one view, the augmented protocol gives access
///   to only that view.
/// - Security warning. These protocols enable a form of clickjacking! While the
///   view hierarchy prevents clickjacking of arbitrary views, care must be
///   taken to route these augmentation protocols to the intended view's
///   component.
/// - Security guarantees. These protocols offer Confidentiality, Integrity, and
///   Availability of the augmented data to authorized components. That is,
///   non-authorized components cannot snoop on this data, modify its contents,
///   or prevent its dispatch to authorized components.
/// - Append semantics. Each augmentation provides augmentation-specific data to
///   the protocol's regular event, but otherwise is not intended to modify the
///   original protocol's basic functionality.
/// - Synchronicity. The augmentation-specific data is synchronous with the
///   original protocol's data.
/// - API evolution. Server-side can introduce new methods to these protocols,
///   and new fields to these tables, without breaking existing clients of the
///   original or augmented protocol. For example, [`MouseEventWithGlobalMouse`]
///   can be extended without consequences for
///   [`fuchsia.ui.pointer.MouseEvent`].
/// - API evolution. When clients require substantially different augmentation,
///   new augmentation protocols representing those capabilities can (and
///   should) be introduced. For example, if one client of [`GlobalMouse`]
///   requires additional fields that are really about view-local hit data, it
///   would be reasonable to mint a new augmentation.
