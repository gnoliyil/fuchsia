/// Component manager uses ComponentController to terminate a component in two
/// steps:
///  1) Component manager calls `Stop()` to indicate that the ComponentRunner
///     should stop a component's execution and close this connection with an
///     epitaph.
///  2) If after some time the ComponentController is not closed, component
///     manager calls `Kill()` to indicate that the ComponentRunner must halt a
///     component's execution immediately, and then close this connection with
///     an epitaph. The component manager may wait some period of time after
///     calling `Kill()` before closing the ComponentController channel, but
///     makes no guarantees it will wait or for how long.
///
/// Component manager first waits for the ComponentController to close, and
/// then tears down the namespace it hosts for the stopped component. Component
/// manager may call `Kill()` without first having called `Stop()`.
///
/// EPITAPH
///
/// This protocol sends a FIDL epitaph to indicate that the component instance
/// has been terminated. The component runner is expected to clean up all
/// resources attributed to the component before closing the connection.
///
/// The following epitaphs may be sent by the server on error:
/// - `ZX_OK`: The component exited successfully, typically because the
///   component was asked to stop or it decided independently to exit.
/// - `INVALID_ARGUMENTS`:
///     * `start_info.resolved_url` is not supported by this
///       runner;
///     * `start_info` contains missing or invalid arguments.
/// - `INSTANCE_CANNOT_START`: The runner could not start the component.
///   For example, a critical part of the program could not be found or
///   loaded, or the referenced binary was invalid for this runner.
/// - `RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE`: The component could not be launched due to
///   lack of resources.
/// - `INTERNAL`: An unexpected internal runner error was encountered.
/// - `INSTANCE_DIED`: The component instance was started but
///   subsequently terminated with an error.
/// - Other status codes (e.g. `ZX_ERR_PEER_CLOSED`) may indicate a failure
///   of the component runner itself. The component manager may respond to such
///   failures by terminating the component runner's job to ensure system
///   stability.
