/// An interface for resolving names to executables and library loaders.
///
/// An executable itself is often not sufficient to create a working process
/// because many executables also load shared libraries. On Fuchsia, there is no
/// global pool of shared libraries. Instead, every process has an associated
/// `fuchsia.ldsvc.Loader`, which provides access to a private pool of shared
/// libraries appropriate for that process.
///
/// This interface provides a protocol for resolving a name into both the
/// `zx.Handle:VMO` for the executable and the `fuchsia.ldsvc.Loader` for its
/// associated shared libraries.
///
/// This interface is rarely used directly. Instead, `fdio_spawn` and
/// `fdio_spawn_etc` use this interface internally when they try to run a file
/// with a `#!resolve` directive.
///
// TODO(https://fxbug.dev/105486): Delete this protocol once it is no longer needed.
