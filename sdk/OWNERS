# SDK approvers
#
# There are two concerns covered here, ownership of what's in the Fuchsia SDK
# and ownership of how the SDK is constructed.
#
# If you'd like to...

# Change a lib:
#   That's "what" the Fuchsia SDK is, but there should be a more specific OWNERS
#   file. If there isn't a more specific file, please create a CL to add an
#   OWNERS file and send that CL to abarth@.
#
# Add a lib/API:
#   That's "what" the Fuchsia SDK is, ask
abarth@google.com
hjfreyer@google.com

# Add/Change how the SDK is built:
#   That's "how" the SDK is made, ask
dschuyler@google.com
