// Blocks until there are no other live references to the pointee of |object|,
// then extracts the field within it indexed by |member_path| during
// destruction, and finally returns it by passing it to |callback|.
//
// In a multi-threaded system, teardown can be safely arranged through the use
// of |std::shared_ptr<T>|: the last strong reference owner is responsible
// for destroying the object, regardless of which thread. However, we would
// often like to observe the destruction of this object, and extract important
// resource within it, on some specific thread. For example, a server binding
// object may be destroyed on any thread, but the "on-unbound" handler should
// always run from the dispatcher thread, and need to extract the transport within
// the server binding as it is being destructed.
//
// That extraction can be safely implemented by declaring a local resource
// variable in the observing thread, and storing its address inside the object
// to be destructed, such that the destructor has the opportunity to move out
// that resource into the local variable on the observing thread.
//
// This function implements this general behavior of the observing thread.
// |Container| is the type of the object that will be destructed, while
// |member_path| is a pointer-to-member from a |Container| type to a
// |ExtractedOnDestruction<Resource>| field. The caller should ensure that there
// are no other long-living strong references to |object|, then move its own
// strong reference into this function, which will trigger the destruction.
