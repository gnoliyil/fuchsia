#ifndef LIB_LD_ABI_H_
#define LIB_LD_ABI_H_

// This defines a common "passive" ABI that runtime code like a C library can
// use to interrogate basic dynamic linking details.  It's called a "passive"
// ABI because it exports almost no entry points, but only some immutable data
// structures and the ELF symbol names by which to find them.
//
// The traditional PT_INTERP dynamic linker sets up this data in memory while
// doing the initial-exec dynamic linking, and then makes it all read-only so
// it's guaranteed never to change again.  The runtime dynamic linking support
// (-ldl) can ingest this data into its own data structures and manage those
// to provide a richer runtime ABI.  Basic fallback implementations of simple
// support calls like dl_iterate_phdr and dlsym can be provided by the C
// library when libdl.so is not linked in.
//
// For out-of-process dynamic linking, a simple stub implementation of this
// same ABI can be loaded in lieu of the traditional dynamic linker, giving
// the same simple runtime ABI for data that is populated out of process.

  // TLS details for initial-exec modules that have PT_TLS segments.  The entry
  // at index `.tls_mod_id - 1` describes that module's PT_TLS.  A module with
  // `.tls_mod_id == 0` has no PT_TLS segment.  TLS module ID numbers above
  // static_tls_modules.size() are not used at startup but may be assigned to
  // dynamically-loaded modules later.
  Span<const TlsModule> static_tls_modules;

  // This is a parallel array to `static_tls_modules` indexed the same way.  It
  // holds the offset from the thread pointer to each module's segment in the
  // static TLS block.  The entry at index `.tls_mod_id - 1` is the offset of
  // that module's PT_TLS segment.
  //
  // This is kept in a simple flat array rather than in a member in each
  // TlsModule so that very simple and efficient code can look up the offsets,
  // perhaps implemented in assembly (such as in TLSDESC hook code or an
  // implementation of __tls_get_addr).  TlsModule describes strictly the
  // information extracted from the module's PT_TLS segment itself and is only
  // used when initializing new thread's static TLS area.  The offsets are
  // dynamically assigned by the dynamic linker at startup, and are referenced
  // by each GD/LD access callback into the runtime.
  //
  // This offset is actually a negative number on some machines like x86, but
  // it's always calculated using address-sized unsigned arithmetic.  On some
  // machines where it's non-negative, there is a nonempty psABI-specified
  // reserved region right after the thread pointer, so a real offset is never
  // zero; other machines like RISC-V do start the first module at offset zero.
  // The ordering of offsets after the first is theoretically arbitrary but is
  // in fact ascending.  When the main executable has a PT_TLS it must have
  // `.tls_mod_id` of 1 and it must have the smallest offset since this is
  // statically calculated by the linker for Local-Exec model accesses based
  // only on the psABI's fixed offset and the PT_TLS alignment requirement.
  Span<const Addr> static_tls_offsets;

  // This gives the required size and alignment of the overall static TLS area.
  // The alignment matches the max of static_tls_modules[...].tls_alignment and
  // any psABI-specified minimum alignment.  The runtime is responsible for
  // adding in space and adjusting alignment as needed for any private data
  // structures or ABI-mandated fixed-offset slots (e.g. stack canary value,
  // secondary stack pointer pseudo-register).  When the thread pointer points
  // to (or after, e.g. on x86) memory of at least this size and alignment,
  // then `$tp + .static_tls_offsets[tls_modid - 1]` will yield a pointer with
  // the space and alignment expected by that module's PT_TLS.
