# Client libraries

This directory contains client libraries for the Fuchsia SDK. These libraries
are part of the Fuchsia API Surface.

In most cases, these libraries are provided for the convenience of developers
targeting Fuchsia. They typically are not part of the
[system ABI](../../docs/concepts/packages/system.md). Instead, the system ABI is
defined by the underlying [FIDL protocols](../fidl/).
