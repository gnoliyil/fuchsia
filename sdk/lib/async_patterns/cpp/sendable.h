// |BindForSending| function packages up |args| so that they may be later
// executed as arguments to |callable| in a different execution context,
// asynchronously and possibly concurrently. This is called "sending". For
// example, |DispatcherBound| uses |BindForSending| to send arguments to the
// object owned by |DispatcherBound|, as part of asynchronously calling their
// member functions.
//
// It is similar to |std::bind_front|, but will first forward the |args| into
// the capture state of the resulting lambda, and then move the captured args
// into |callable| when invoked later.
//
// ## Safety of sending arguments
//
// Because the |args| are used at a later time, one needs to be aware of risks
// of use-after-free and dace races. There are also the following restrictions:
//
// - Value types may be sent via copying or moving. Whether one passes an |Arg|,
//   |const Arg&|, or |Arg&&| etc on the sending side, the |callable| will have
//   its own uniquely owned instance that they may safely manipulate.
//
// - Move-only types such as |std::unique_ptr<Arg>| may be sent via |std::move|.
//
// - The |callable| may not take raw pointer or non-const reference arguments.
//   Sending those may result in use-after-frees when the callable uses a
//   pointee asynchronously after an unspecified amount of time. It's not worth
//   the memory safety risks to support the cases where a pointee outlives the
//   dispatcher that is running tasks for |T|.
//
// - If the |callable| takes |const Arg&| as an argument, one may send an
//   instance of |Arg| via copying or moving. The instance will live until the
//   callable finishes executing.
//
// - When sending a ref-counted pointer such as |std::shared_ptr<Arg>|, both the
//   sender and the |callable| will be able to concurrently access |Arg|. Be
//   sure to add appropriate synchronization to |Arg|, for example protecting
//   fields with mutexes. This pattern is called "shared-state concurrency".
//
// - These checks are performed for each argument, but there could still be raw
//   pointers or references inside an object that is sent. One must ensure that
//   the pointee remain alive until the asynchronous tasks are run, possibly
//   indefinitely until the dispatcher is destroyed.
//
