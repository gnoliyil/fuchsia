// Magma is the driver model for GPUs/NPUs on Fuchsia.
//
// Magma has two driver components: a hardware-specific library loaded into an "application"â€™s
// address space ("client driver", sometimes known as "Installable client driver" or "ICD");
// and a system driver that interfaces with the hardware. Magma is described in detail at [0].
//
// The Magma APIs are vendor independent. Some drivers may implement only the subset of the
// APIs that are relevant. The format of data carried inside commands/command buffers is not
// defined. Some APIs are explicitly extensible, such as magma_query, to allow for specific
// vendor/driver needs.  Vendor specifics must be contained in a separate definitions file.
//
// Since client driver implementations may be written in a variety of languages (possibly C),
// the Magma bindings have a C interface, and may be used to interact with both Magma and Sysmem.
//
// The Magma bindings are OS independent so a client driver targeting Magma can easily be built
// for Fuchsia or Linux. On Fuchsia the APIs are backed by Zircon and FIDL; for virtualized Linux
// they are backed by a virtualization transport (virtmagma). APIs prefixed by 'magma_virt_' are
// for virtualization only.  32-bit and 64-bit builds are supported for virtualized clients.
//
// On Fuchsia the system driver is a separate process, so Magma APIs follow a feed forward design
// where possible to allow for efficient pipelining of requests.
