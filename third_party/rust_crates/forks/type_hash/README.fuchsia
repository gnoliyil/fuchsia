Description:

* This crate creates hashes (fingerprints) of the layout of rust structs.
* It's used to identify format-breaking changes in Fxfs.
* It is 'forked' here to fix a misconfiguration until it can be addressed upstream.
* This is a virtual manifest consisting of three package.
* Nothing else is special about this.

The misconfiguration relates to mixing of versions:
  1. type_hash v0.3.0 depends on type_hash_core v0.2.0.
  2. type_hash_core v0.2.0 lacks a repository reference on crates.io, but has one in the latest git repo.
  3. Fuchsia's license checker depends on this repository reference to find the LICENSE file for a crate.

Also note:
 * the v0.2.0 version on crates.io also specifies 'license="MIT"' in its Cargo.toml.
 * this virtual manifest contains a valid LICENSE file.

We can drop this fork when upstream is updated to address these issues.
