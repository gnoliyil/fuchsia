Description:

nix is used in various places for host-side networking and tooling.

This fork comes from the commit in https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/issues/1975 which came out a rust-tp review (https://fxrev.dev/780283).
This is nix mainline (~0.26.2) with a patch.

There is nothing else special about this release the fork is cut from mainline.

This fork can be removed once the pull request is rolled into mainline and a release is cut.
