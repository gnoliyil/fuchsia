# Set bors's timeout to 1 hour
#
# bors's timeout should always be at least twice as long as the test suite
# takes.  This is to allow the CI provider to fast-fail a test; if one of the
# builders immediately reports a failure, then bors will move on to the next
# batch, leaving the slower builders to work through the already-doomed run and
# the next one.
#
# At the time this was written, nix's test suite took about twenty minutes to
# run.  The timeout was raised to one hour to give nix room to grow and time
# for delays on Cirrus's end.
