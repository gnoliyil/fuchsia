* What is this crate used for?
Creating pretty tables for printing to console.

* Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts
No.

* What differs from upstream? Include a changelog if feasible.
Contains changes from https://github.com/phsym/prettytable-rs/pull/146 to
resolve https://github.com/phsym/prettytable-rs/issues/145.

* Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?
No.

* Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?
We're hot patching because there is undefined behavior blocking a toolchain
release, and crate authors are not acting after 3 weeks.
