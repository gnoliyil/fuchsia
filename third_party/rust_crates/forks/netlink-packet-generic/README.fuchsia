Description:

# What is this crate used for?

At time of writing, parsing netlink messages for generic-type subsystems.

# Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts

No.

# What differs from upstream?

constants.rs is updated to use fixed values rather then pulling them from libc. These
values are present in libc on Linux, but not Fuchsia.
https://github.com/rust-netlink/netlink-packet-generic/pull/7 fixes this upstream.

ctrl/nlas/mod.rs is patched to fix broken output when mcast groups are in use.
https://github.com/rust-netlink/netlink-packet-generic/pull/8 fixes this upstream.

TODO(fxbug.dev/129217): Move this out of forks/ when changes are upstreamed.

# Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?

No.

# Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?

No.
