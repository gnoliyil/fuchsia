Name: zstd
Description:

# What is this crate used for?

The `zstd` crate uses it for bindings to the native zstd library.

# Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts

No.

# What differs from upstream?

We don't include a vendored copy of ztsd and we generate the bindings using our prebuilt copy of
bindgen.

# Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?

The version number used can be updated as needed by updates to the zstd crate, and the contents of
the crate can be updated as needed to match rolls of our native zstd implementation.

# Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?

No.
