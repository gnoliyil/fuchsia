Description:

# What is this crate used for?

At the time of writing, reading and writing WAV files for use in the ffx audio plugin.

# Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts

Will be only used in development tools, both on host or on-target-device.

# What differs from upstream?

Safety changes to avoid undefined behavior. These changes landed in
[this PR](https://github.com/ruuda/hound/pull/58) to the upstream master branch,
but were not included in 3.5.0 release.

# Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?

This fork can be deleted after the next release includes our patch.

We expect that the next release will include our PR. If it does, this fork can be replaced
with a direct mirror of the upstream release. If our PR is not included in the next release,
the fork should be continued and our PR should be cherry-picked onto that release.

# Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?

No.
