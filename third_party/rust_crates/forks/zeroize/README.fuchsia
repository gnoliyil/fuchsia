Description:

## What is this crate used for?

zeroize is a transitive (sometimes optional) dependency of crates in the RustCrypto ecosystem.

* Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts

This crate should not be used, this implementation is a no-op that is kept for compatibility with
existing dependents.

* What differs from upstream? Include a changelog if feasible.

Only function signatures and trait definitions are left, no implementation bodies remain.

* Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?

Consult with //third_party/rust_crates/OWNERS.

* Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?

No.
