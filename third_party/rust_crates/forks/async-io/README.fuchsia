Description:

async-io is used only on the host side to provide async usage of *nix IO primitives.

This is mainline with the patch from https://github.com/smol-rs/async-io/pull/79/commits/71cd97d34ed8c652074b61ed4093b475e2fb4fdd included.

This is async-io mainline (~1.12.0) with a patch.

There is nothing else special about this release the fork is cut from mainline.

This fork can be removed if the pull request is rolled into mainline and a
release is cut, but upstream is in a semi-abandoned state so this may not happen
soon.
