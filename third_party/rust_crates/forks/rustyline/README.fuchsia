* What differs from upstream? Include a changelog if feasible.
  This previously existed under //third_party/rust_crates/mirrors/rustyline,
  a [separate fuchsia repository](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/third_party/rust-mirrors/rustyline/).

  It forked from upstream rustyline 2.1.0 in 2018.
  (See this [pull request](https://github.com/kkawakam/rustyline/pull/130) that was never merged.)

  Changelog since forked:

      [rust] Avoid warning for unused fields

      Upstream rustc has expanded the unused field lint to to not count
      usages performed by derived Clone and Debug implementations.
      https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85200

      This CL marks such fields with an #[allow(unused)] tag.

      [rustyline] Add host support for unix systems.

      This change very slightly tweaks rustyline (a 2 line change) to remove
      the requirement of using the dirs::crate. Since windows builds through
      cygwin anyway this just assumes the std::env "$HOME" will be set if
      built for host targets. This change also updates the library to support
      the version of nix we use in tree. These small modifications allow
      rustyline to build with host support correctly.

      [rust] Remove dependency on fuchsia-device library

      underlying call has been broken for a while. This isn't
      a great long-term solution, so removing bad dependency
      instead of investing engineering effort.

      Clarify as_ref to &str

      as_ref is more ambiguous about the target type
      than &*. This change is necessary to allow
      rustyline to build on an updated toolchain.

  ```

  Note: The old repo no longer be used, but must continue to exist (in read-only form) or else
  we will break the ability to sync back to previous Fuchsia builds.

* Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?
  No.

* Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?
  The dependency itself is not special, but the rationale for it being here may be worthwhile mentioning.

  This was moved from a separate repo to an in-tree "forks/" so that build dependencies could be updated along
  with required code changes. Previously BUILD.gn was stored in-tree (//third_party/rust_crates/compat/rustyline/BUILD.gn)
  which made it non-trivial to update both atomically.
