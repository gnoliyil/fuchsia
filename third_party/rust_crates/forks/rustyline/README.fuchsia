* What is this crate used for?
Various 'readline' use cases throughout Fuchsia.

* Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts
No

* What differs from upstream? Include a changelog if feasible.

This previously existed under //third_party/rust_crates/mirrors/rustyline,
a [separate fuchsia repository](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/third_party/rust-mirrors/rustyline/).

Note: The old repo no longer be used, but must continue to exist (in read-only form) or else
we will break the ability to sync back to previous Fuchsia builds.

* Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?
No.

* Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?
The dependency itself is not special, but the rationale for it being here may be worthwhile mentioning.

This was moved from a separate repo to an in-tree "forks/" so that build dependencies could be updated along
with required code changes. Previously BUILD.gn was stored in-tree (//third_party/rust_crates/compat/rustyline/BUILD.gn)
which made it non-trivial to update both atomically.
