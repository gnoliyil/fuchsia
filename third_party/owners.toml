# This file controls the output of `fx update-3p-owners` when generating OWNERS
# files for our external projects. For each project here, the listed paths will
# be added to the generated file as `include`s.
# Project overrides are indexed by the project path without the version suffix,
# thus the same overrides will be used for all versions of a project.
#
# For more information, see the update process' documentation.[0]
