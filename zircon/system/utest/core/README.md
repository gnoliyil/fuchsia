# utest/core

The "core" tests exist for one main purpose:
To test basic functionality when things like devmgr aren't working.

There are three different ways in which core tests are built and run:
unified, standalone, and as Fuchsia components.

## Unified mode

In this mode, all core tests are built into a single executable that
is directly invoked by the kernel. That is, the kernel is told to run
core-tests instead of devmgr.  In this mode the tests will run without
any userspace device manager, device drivers, io plumbing, etc.

### Example usage

```sh
fx set bringup.x64 --with //bundles:boot_tests  # or any product or board.
fx build
fx core-tests [--gtest_filter=FILTER] [--gtest_repeat=REPEAT]
```

The helper fx command runs QEMU (or FEMU) providing the
specially-built core-tests.zbi as a `-z` argument.

Only a subset of tests can be specified by `gtest_filter`, e.g.
`--gtest_filter="FutexTest.*"`

Tests can be rerun with `gtest_repeat`, e.g.
`--gtest_repeat=100` to run all tests 100 times or
`--gtest_repeat=-1` to run all tests until a test fails.

## Standalone mode

In this mode, each test is built into its own binary which can be run
"manually" from a serial shell or via runtests.  Not all core tests
can operate in standalone mode.  For example, some tests require the
root resource which is only available to tests running in unified
mode.  See `unified_only` in BUILD.gn for a list of such tests.

### Example usage

```sh
fx set bringup.x64 --with-base //bundles/bringup:tests
fx build
fx qemu
```

Then at the shell prompt,

```sh
/boot/test/core-futex --gtest_filter='FutexTest.Wakeup' --gtest_repeat=10
```

or

```sh
runtests /boot/test/core-*
```

## Fuchsia components

In this mode, each test is built into its own binary and wrapped up as a
component in a package. Not all core tests can operate in this mode, and some
tests require policies that are not granted to regular components. Some tests
are not available in this mode and some tests skip specific cases in this mode.

This mode can provide a faster iteration cycle for the tests since the
edit-compile-test cycle only needs to rebuild and update the package containing
the test and not rebuilding or rebooting the system.

Some tests require the next vDSO, which is not available in the
standalone mode on bringup builds. These tests are built as standalone
binaries and packaged as Fuchsia components instead of standalone bootfs
tests. Note that this is a temporary workaround for the next vDSO not
being available in the standalone mode in bringup builds. Refer to
fxbug.dev/89597 for more context. See `requires_next_vdso` in BUILD.gn
for a list of such tests.

### Example usage

```sh
fx set core.x64 --with //zircon/system/utest/core:tests
fx build
fx ffx emu start --engine qemu --headless --net user
```

Then on the host,

```sh
fx test fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/core-page-size-test-package
```

### Limitations

In this mode the set of job policies applied to the tests is restricted compared
to the unified and standalone modes. Some test cases are skipped due to missing
these policies:

* ZX_POL_NEW_PROCESS

  If this policy is not available, the environment variable "NO_NEW_PROCESS=1" is
set and tests requiring this are skipped.

* ZX_POL_AMBIENT_MARK_VMO_EXEC

  If this policy is not available, the environment variable
"NO_AMBIENT_MARK_VMO_EXEC=1" is set and tests requiring this are skipped.

## Notes

The tests here are for "core" functionality (channels, etc.), but
not all "core" functionality can go here.  For example, you can't
start a process in your test with launchpad because core tests are for
when that functionality isn't working.  Core tests can't use fdio and
launchpad uses fdio.

Since these tests can't use fdio core/libc-and-io-stubs.c stubs out the needed
functions from fdio.

An additional kernel debugging option of kernel.pmm.alloc-random-should-wait is
enabled for these tests. It has a small performance overhead for the purpose of
exercising some of the allocation paths that otherwise are only executed under
certain OOM conditions. This path exploration is random and the errors may be
realized in any of the core tests, and should not be ignored.
