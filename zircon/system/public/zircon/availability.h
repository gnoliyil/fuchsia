// Emulate a "HEAD" API level since it is not supported directly by clang.
// Fuchsia API levels are unsigned 64-bit integers, but clang stores API levels as 32-bit,
// so we define this as `((uint32_t)-1)`. clang expects API levels to be literals.

// An API that was added to the platform.
//
// Annotates the API level at which the API was added to the platform. Use
// ZX_DEPRECATED_SINCE if the API is later deprecated.
//
// Example:
//
//   void fdio_spawn(...) ZX_AVAILABLE_SINCE(4);
//
#define ZX_AVAILABLE_SINCE(level_added) \
  __attribute__((availability(fuchsia, strict, introduced = level_added)))

// An API that was added the platform and later deprecated.
//
// Annotates the API level at which the API added the platform and the API
// level at which the API was deprecated.
//
// Deprecated API can still be called by clients. The deprecation annotation
// is a warning that the API is likely to be removed in the future. APIs should
// be deprecated for at least one API level before being removed.
//
// Use the `msg` parameter to explain why the API was deprecated and what
// clients should do instead of using the API.
//
// Example:
//
//   void fdio_fork(...) ZX_DEPRECATED_SINCE(1, 4,
//       "Root cause of security vulnerabilities due to implicit handle "
//       "transfer. Use fdio_spawn instead.");

// An API that was added to the platform and later removed.
//
// Annotates the API level at which the API added the platform, the API
// level at which the API was deprecated, and the API level at which the API

//
// Clients can no longer call APIs if they are compiled to target an API
// level at, or beyond, the level at which the API was removed. APIs should be
// deprecated for at least one API level before being removed.
//
// Example:
//
//   void fdio_fork(...) ZX_REMOVED_SINCE(1, 4, 8,
//       "Root cause of security vulnerabilities due to implicit handle "
//       "transfer. Use fdio_spawn instead.");
