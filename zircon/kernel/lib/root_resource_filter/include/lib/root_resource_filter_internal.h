// The RootResourceFilter tracks the regions of the various resource address
// spaces we may never grant access to, even if the user has access to the root
// resource. Currently this only affects the MMIO space. Any attempt to register
// a deny range for some other resource will succeed, but no enforcement will
// happen.  The current set of denied MMIO ranges should consist of:
//
// 1) All physical RAM. RAM is under the control of the PMM. If a user wants
//    access to RAM, they need to obtain it via VMO allocations, not by
//    requesting a specific region of the physical bus using
//    zx_vmo_create_physical.
// 2) Any other regions the platform code considers to be off limits. This
//    usually means things like the interrupt controller registers, the IOMMU
//    registers, and so on.
//
// Note that we don't bother assigning a RegionPool to our region allocator,
// instead we permit it to allocate directly from the heap. The set of
// regions that we need to deny is 100% known to us, but it is never going to
// be a large number of regions, and once established it will never change.
// There is no good reason to partition the bookkeeping allocations into their
// own separate slab allocated pool.
