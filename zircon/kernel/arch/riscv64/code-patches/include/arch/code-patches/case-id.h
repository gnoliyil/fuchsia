// involving the wholesale patching of a specific function are expected to be
// defined as `CASE_ID_${NAME}`, where `${NAME}` is the upper-cased version of
// the function name.

// This case serves as a verification that code-patching was performed before
// the kernel was booted, `nop`ing out a trap among the kernel's earliest
