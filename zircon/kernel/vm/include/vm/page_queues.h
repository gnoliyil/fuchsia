  //      their age effectively decreased by being moved to the next queue.

  // [][ ][ ][] -------> [][ ][a][] -------> [][ ][a][ ] -------> [][ ][a][ ] -------> [ ][ ][a][]
  //
  // At this point page A, in its vm_page_t, has its queue marked as 3, and the page_queue_counts
  // are {0,0,1,0}, but the page itself remains in the linked list for queue 2. If the LRU queue is
  // then processed to increment it we would do.
  //
  //  MRU  LRU             MRU  LRU            MRU    LRU
  //    |  |                 |    |              |      |
