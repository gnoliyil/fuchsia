// At the high level the goal of the objects here is to
// 1. Trigger external entities to do work based on VMO operations, such as asking a pager to supply
//    a missing page of data.
// 2. Have a way for external entities to let the VMO system know these requests have been
//    fulfilled.
// 3. Provide a way for the high level caller, who may not know what actions are being performed on
//    what entities, to wait until their operation can be completed.
//
// The different objects can be summarized as:
//  * PageRequest: Caller allocated object that the caller uses to perform the Wait.
//  * PageRequestInterface: A reference to an object implementing this interface is held by the
//    PageRequest and provides a way for the PageRequest to interact with the underlying PageSource.
//  * PageSource: Performs request and overlap tracking, forwarding unique ranges of requests to the
//    underlying PageProvider.
//  * PageProvider: Asynchronously performs requests. Requests are completed by actions being
//    performed on the VMO.
//
// A typical flow would be
//  * User allocates PageRequest on the stack, and passes it in to some VMO operation
//  * VMO code needs something to happen and calls a PageSource method, passing in PageRequest it
//    had been given.
//  * PageSource populates fields of the PageRequest and adds it to the list of requests it is
//    tracking, and determines how this request overlaps with any others. Based on overlap, it may
//    or may not notify the underlying PageProvider that some work needs to be done (the page
//    provider will complete this asynchronously somehow).
//  * VMO returns ZX_ERR_SHOULD_WAIT and then the top level calls PageRequest::Wait
//  * PageRequest::Wait uses the PageRequestInterface to ask the underlying PageSource how to Wait
//    for the operation to complete
//  # As an optional path, if the PageRequest was not Waited on for some reason, the PageRequest
//    will also use the PageRequestInterface to inform the PageSource that this request is no longer
//    needed and can be canceled.
// For the other side, while the Wait is happening some other thread will
//  * Call a VMO operation, such as VmObject::SupplyPages
//  * VMO will perform the operation, and then let the PageSource know by the corresponding
//    interface method, such as OnPagesSupplied.
//  * PageSource will update request tracking, and notify any PageRequests that were waiting and can
//    be woken up.
//
// There is more complexity of implementation and API, largely to handle the fact that the
// PageRequest serves as the allocation of all data needed for all parties. Therefore every layer
// needs to be told when requests are coming and going to ensure they update any lists and do not
// refer to out of scope stack variables.

// implementation, which is responsible for actually providing the pages. (E.g. for VMOs backed by a
// userspace pager, the PageProvider is a PagerProxy instance which talks to the userspace pager
// service.)
//
// The synchronous fulfillment of requests is fairly straightforward, with direct calls
// from the vm object to the PageSource to the PageProvider.
//
// For asynchronous requests, the lifecycle is as follows:
//   1) A vm object requests a page with PageSource::GetPage.
//   2) PageSource starts tracking the request's PageRequest and then
//      forwards the request to PageProvider::SendAsyncRequest.

//      to the vm object (e.g. with VmObjectPaged::SupplyPages).
//   5) The vm object calls PageSource::OnPagesSupplied, which signals
//      any PageRequests that have been fulfilled.
//   6) The caller wakes up and queries the vm object again, by which
//      point the requested page will be present.
