// 1) one-shot eviction, which involves arming an eviction target and triggering eviction
// and
// 2) continuous eviction, which creates a dedicated thread to perform periodic evictions to
// maintain a free memory level.
// Eviction in this context is both direct eviction of pager backed memory and discardable VMO
// memory, as well as by performing compression.
