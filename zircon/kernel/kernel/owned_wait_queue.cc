// Notes on the defined kernel counters.
//
// Adjustments (aka promotions and demotions)
// The number of times that a thread increased or decreased its priority because
// of a priority inheritance related event.
//
// Note that the number of promotions does not have to equal the number of
// demotions in the system.  For example, a thread could slowly climb up in priority as
// threads of increasing priority join a wait queue it owns, then suddenly drop
// back down to its base priority when it releases its queue.
//
// There are other (more complicated) sequences which could cause a thread to
// jump up in priority with one promotion, then slowly step back down again over
// multiple demotions.
//
// Reschedule events.
// Counts of the number of times that a local reschedule was requested, as well
// as the total number of reschedule IPIs which were sent, as a result of
// priority inheritance related events.
//
// Max chain traversal.
// The maximum traversed length of a PI chain during exection of the propagation
// algorithm.
//
// IOW - if a change to a wait queue's maximum effective priority ends up
// changing the inherited priority of thread A, but nothing else is needed, this
// is a traversal length of 1.  OTOH, if thread A was blocked by a wait queue
// (Qa) which was owned by thread B, and Qa's maximum effective priority, then
// the algorithm would need to traverse another link in the chain, and our
// traversed chain length would be at least 2.
//
// Note that the maximum traversed chain length does not have to be the length
// maximum PI chain ever assembled in the system.  This is a result of the fact
// that the PI algortim attempt to terminate propagation as soon as it can, as
// well as the fact that changes can start to propagate in the middle of a chain
// instead of being required to start at the end (for example, 2 chains of
// length 2 could merge to form a chain of length 4, but still result in a
// traversal of only length 1).
