  // CPU, and will release the mutex shortly.
  //
  // If we manage to acquire the mutex during the spin phase, we can simply
  // exit, having achieved our goal.  Otherwise, there are 3 reasons we may end
  // up terminating the spin phase and dropping into a block operation.
  //
  // 1) We exceed the system's configured |spin_max_duration|.
  // 2) The mutex is marked as CONTESTED, meaning that at least one other thread
  //    has dropped out of its spin phase and blocked on the mutex.
  // 3) We think that there is a reasonable chance that the owner of this mutex
  //    was assigned to the same core that we are running on.
  //
  // Notes about #3:
  //
  // In order to implement this behavior, the Mutex class maintains a variable
  // called |maybe_acquired_on_cpu_|.  This is the system's best guess as to
  // which CPU the owner of the mutex may currently be assigned to. The value of
  // the variable is set when a thread successfully acquires the mutex, and
  // cleared when the thread releases the mutex later on.
  //
  // This behavior is best effort; the guess is just a guess and could be wrong
  // for several legitimate reasons.  The owner of the mutex will assign the
  // variable to the value of the CPU is it running on immediately after it
  // successfully mutates the mutex state to indicate that it owns the mutex.
  //
  // A spinning thread my observe:
  // 1) A value of INVALID_CPU, either because of weak memory ordering, or
  //    because the thread was preempted after updating the mutex state, but
  //    before recording the assigned CPU guess.
  // 2) An incorrect value of the assigned CPU, again either because of weak
  //    memory ordering, or because the thread either moved to a different CPU
  //    or blocked after the guess was recorded.
  //
  // So, it is possible to keep spinning when we probably shouldn't, and also
  // possible to drop out of a spin when we might want to stay in it.
