# PCI

The PCI bus driver provides management of the PCI bus in applicable systems and allows device drivers to be written for and bind to PCI devices in the system.

# Architecture

## Source

### Location

* [`//src/devices/bus/drivers/pci`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/devices/bus/drivers/pci/)

### Organization

Bus level operations are handled in `bus.cc`. Device specific operations are in `device_*.cc`, and FIDL / Banjo protocol implementations are in `fidl.cc` and `banjo.cc` respectively. The interface between a Device and the Bus is the `BusDeviceInterface` specified in `bus_device_interface.h`. The service implementation `fuchsia.hardware.pci/Service` used by `lspci` is in `device_service.cc`.

### Build Targets

* [`//src/devices/bus/drivers/pci:bus-pci`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/devices/bus/drivers/pci/BUILD.gn;l=86) for the driver.

## FIDL

### Dependent Protocols

The PCI bus driver binds to [`fuchsia.hardware.pciroot/Pciroot`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:sdk/banjo/fuchsia.hardware.pciroot/pciroot.fidl) and receives platform level information for ACPI (if applicable), interrupts, interrupt routing, and bus configuration.

### Implemented Protocols

* [`//fuchsia/sdk/fidl/fuchsia.hardware.pci/pci.fidl`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:sdk/fidl/fuchsia.hardware.pci/pci.fidl)
  * `fuchsia.hardware.pci/Device`: Provides the interface to develop PCI device drivers
  * `fuchsia.hardware.pci/Service`: Enables device information export for use with lspci

## Libraries

* [`//src/devices/pci/lib/device-protocol-pci:device-protocol-pci`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/devices/pci/lib/device-protocol-pci/BUILD.gn;l=7)
  * Provides helper methods `MapMmio` and `ConfigureInterruptMode` for use with drivers, as well as convenience methods for constructing a client end for `fuchsia.hardware.pci/Device` calls.
* [`//src/devices/pci/lib/pci:pci`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/devices/pci/lib/pci/BUILD.gn;l=9)
  * Provides base implementations for the `PciRootHost` interface which provides a way for a platform to implement a backing driver that can service multiple `fuchsia.hardware.pciroot/Pciroot` instances to support multiple PCI buses in the system.
* [`//src/devices/pci/testing:pci-protocol-fake`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/devices/pci/testing/BUILD.gn;l=14)
  * Provides a fake `fuchsia.hardware.pci/Device` implementation for use in unit testing, allowing users to create fake PCI devices that match the configuration of their real hardware.

# Testing

## Tests

## Fakes

Fakes exist for most major classes in the PCI bus driver and can be found in [`//src/devices/bus/drivers/pci/test/fakes/`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/devices/bus/drivers/pci/test/fakes/)

# Debugging

## Inspect

Inspect data for both the Bus and all devices are exported via `bootstrap/driver_manager` under `class/pci/*.inspect`:

```
