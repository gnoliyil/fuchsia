# TODO(https://fxbug.dev/77388): enable tests to select only 1 of the 3
# root device drivers (test, misc, and sys).
#
# This is a workaround to include the sysdev test driver as the sys root
# device driver. It would be better to do this by specifying the
# `--sys-device-driver` flag to `driver-manager-test`, but this is
# currently not possible to do at build time with the v2 isolated_devmgr
# template. With this flag unspecified, `driver-manager-test` falls back to
# looking for driver/platform-bus.so, so we rename this sys driver to that.
