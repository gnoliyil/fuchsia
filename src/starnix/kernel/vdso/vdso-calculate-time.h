// Defined by vdso.ld.
//
// This declaration needs to be explicitly annotated with the hidden visibility
// attribute to let the compiler know that the definition for vvar can be found
// within the VDSO itself and does not need to include an entry in the dynamic
// relocation table to resolve the address for vvar at runtime. Without this,
// the loader will try to resolve the entry at runtime but doing that requires
// write access to the VDSO memory mapping (to modify the entry itself) which
// starnix does not provide (VDSO mapping only has readable/executable) so we
// end up segmentation faulting when the loader performs the write. This issue
// has so far only been observed when using Android's init[1] on aarch64. See
// this[2] gist to see how the symbol tables differ on x86_64 and aarch64 with
// an example.
//
// Note that the VDSO is compiled with -fvisibility=hidden but this only affects
// the _default symbol visibility for definitions_[3]; the compiler still needs
// to be told that the definition for vvar can be found in the VDSO itself.
