// Linux virt queue negotiation increments queue index only for supported queue
// In the case of the balloon we have page hinting queue using index 3, but we
// don't use this queue. We use the following free page reporting queue which
// has index 4 in the spec. But since we don't advertise free page hinting
// support Linux will initialise free page reporting queue as number 3. See
// https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.0/source/drivers/virtio/virtio_balloon.c#L527
// and
// https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.0/source/drivers/virtio/virtio_pci_common.c#L376
// Hence the reason to use 3 here instead of what is defined in the spec
// Alternative would be to advertise and don't use free page hinting

//
// 4096 is historical, and independent of the guest page size.
