# Display Driver for Intel GPUs

## Target Hardware

Changes to the driver should be reviewed against the documentation for the
following hardware.

* Tiger Lake - on Intel NUC11
* Kaby Lake - on Google Pixelbook (eve), Google Pixelbook Go (atlas), and Intel
  NUC7
* Skylake - on Acer Switch Alpha 12

Some of the hardware listed here is not supported, meaning we don't regularly
run tests on it. [The hardware development page][fuchsia-development-hardware]
on fuchsia.dev has the most up to date hardware support status.

## Documentation References

### Intel Programmer Manuals

The driver code here is based on the
[Programmer's Reference Manuals][intel-graphics-prms] published by Intel for
graphics driver developers.

To facilitate reviews, driver code should include comments pointing to the
relevant manual sections. Reference comments should include the following parts:

1. The document reference ID, such as `IHD-OS-TGL-Vol 2c-12.21`. This
   facilitates searching for a downloadable version of the manual.
1. The section title, such as `"Sequences for DisplayPort" > "Enable Sequence"`.
   This facilitates searching for equivalent information in a different manual.
   This example uses a two-level section name because `"Enable Sequence"` is too
   generic, resulting in too many hits.
1. A part number, if the document is split in multiple parts. For example,
   `IHD-OS-TGL-Vol 2c-12.21` is split into two parts. Without a `Part 1` /
   `Part 2` qualifier, page numbers would be ambiguous.
1. A page number or page range, such as `pages 143-145`. This optimizes for
   reviewers who need to check that the code matches the documentation.

The most relevant manuals for this driver are:

* [Tiger Lake (TGL)][intel-tgl-prm]
* [Kaby Lake (KBL)][intel-kbl-prm]
* [Skylake (SKL)][intel-skl-prm]
* [IGD OpRegion / Software SCI][intel-opregion-prm]
