# Display driver for AMLogic display engines

## Hardware model

AMLogic's documentation makes heavy use of acronyms. This section goes over the
acronyms for the top-level modules, and briefly describes their functionality.

The entire display engine is generally called the VPU (Video Processing Unit).
It is also called the Video Output Unit in the high-level overview (A311D
datasheet Section 2.2 "Features").

The display engine is split into the VIU (Video Input Unit), which is the
engine's frontend, and the VOUT (Video Output), which is the engine's backend.

### VIU (Video Input Unit)

The display engine can have multiple VIU instances. The AMLogic A311D has two
VIUs (VIU1, VIU2), so it can drive two displays at once.

Each VIU has multiple input channels that retrieve pixel data (scanout) and feed
it into a VPP (Video Post-Processing) unit, which performs image processing such
as scaling, blending, and CSC (color space conversion, including color and gamma
correction). In other display engines, the input channels are called planes or
layers, and the entire VIU is called a pipe.

The VIU has two types of input channels, listed below.

* OSD (On-Screen Display) channels produce RGB data
* VD (Video Display) channels produce YUV data

The VD channels support Chroma-downsampled planar formats, such as YUV 4:2:0.
The channels do Chroma upsampling before feeding the data to VPP.

Each VIU has multiple VD channels and OSD channels. The VIUs in AMLogic A311D
have two VD channels (VD1, VD2) and four OSD channels (OSD1, OSD2, OSD3, OSD4).

#### Rationalization for the naming scheme

This subsection is speculation, as there is no documentation explaining the
reasoning behind names. With that being said, a plausible explanation for the
input channel naming scheme points to the STB (TV set-top box) use case, which
is prominently mentioned in the AMLogic datasheets and quick start manuals.

The typical setup uses a VD channel to display the TV video, sourced from a
video decoder that produces YUV data. The second VD plane may be used for
picture-in-picture or to display two TV channels side-by-side.

The OSD planes display "control panels", which are rendered by software running
on the AMLogic processor. RGB is the preferred pixel format for rendering.

### VOUT (Video Output)

All documented display engines have a single VOUT instance.

Conceptually, the VOUT consists of a VENC (Video Encoder) stage that converts
processed image data into a video signal, and an analog front-end stage that
contains PHYs (physical layer) for transmitting the video signal via various
connectors.

The VOUT hosts a few encoder blocks. Each encoder is unique in terms of the
properties of its output signal. Each VIN can be connected to an encoder. There
is very little flexibility in connecting encoders to PHYs, because display
connectors require specific signals.

#### VENC (Video Encoders)

The VENC stage has the encoders below.

* ENCI (Interlaced signal encoder) - designed to produce 480i (compatible with
  NTSC, which has 483 visible lines per frame) and 576i (compatible with PAL,
  which has 576 visible lines per frame) signals
* ENCP (Progressive signal encoder) - designed for progressive encoding, but can
  also produce an 1080i signal
* ENCL (LCD panel encoder) - designed for DSI signals
* ENCT (TV panel encoder) - not documented

The ENCI and ENCP encoders have attached TDMS encoders (ENCI_DVI, ENCP_DVI),
which produce signals compatible with the HDMI and DVI standards. The AMLogic
documentation uses "ENCI" and "ENCP" to refer both to the raw encoder outputs
and the TDMS encoder outputs.

#### Analog front-end

The analog front-end stage contains PHY (physical layer) transmitters for the
following display connectors.

* CVBS - outputs the ENCI signal via a VDAC (Video DAC)
* HDMI - can receive the signal from ENCI_DVI or ENCP_DVI
* MIPI DSI - receives signal from ENCL

The HDMI block embeds a Synopsis DWC (DesignWare Core) HDMI Controller IP, which
is connected to an HDMI PHY. The AMLogic documentation refers to the DesignWare
IP as "HDMI TX Controller IP", and to the integration glue as "HDMITX Top-Level"
(HDMI_TOP and HDMITX_TOP). Driving the HDMI block entails configuring registers
in both the AMLogic TOP and in the DesignWare IP.

The MIPI DSI block follows a similar structure.

The analog frontend conceptually belongs to the HHI (undocumented acronym),
which hosts a variety of analog-digital circuits including PHYs, power gates,
and PLLs (Phased Lock Loops) used by the clock tree.

### The canvas table

The VPU accesses DRAM using the on-chip DMC (DRAM Memory Controller). The VPU is
connected to the DMC via AMBus, a specialized bus optimized for burst transfers.
For example, on A311D, the VPU has 5 dedicated AMBus channels (3 for read
requests, 2 for write requests) to the DMC.

AMBus transactions to the DMC use the canvas table for address translation. Each
entry in the canvas table describes a canvas, which is a contiguous region in
DRAM designated for storing pixel data, associated with metadata describing a
specific pixel format. Each AMBus transaction executes in the context of a
canvas table entry, identified by a canvas index.

The canvas table is accessed using registers in the DMC's MMIO address space.
The table is likely stored in SRAM inside the DMC, because AMLogic datasheets
state that canvas translation is latency-free.

### RDMA (Register Direct Memory Access)

The RDMA (Register Direct Memory Access) engine accelerates flips (configuring
the VPU for displaying the next frame, after a VSync), which entail writing a
block of VPU registers. The RDMA engine out-performs a sequence of MMIO writes
because it has a direct access path to the VCBus (Video Controller Bus) that
the VPU registers are attached to.

## Mapping to Intel display engine concepts

For historical reasons, many Fuchsia developers are familiar with Intel's
display engines. The following mapping may give a head start to these
developers.

* OSD, VD (VIU input channels) - display plane streamers
* VIU - display pipe
* VPP - image processing logic (CSC, scaler, LUTs) in planes and pipes
* VENC, ENCI, ENCP, ENCL, ECNT - transcoders
* HHI - DDIs (digital display interfaces) including PLLs, PHYs, and power gates
* Canvas - surface (source of pixel data for a plane)
* Canvas table - GGTT (Global Graphics Translation Table)
* RDMA engine - DSB (Display State Buffer) engine

Just like "no model is entirely correct, but some models are useful", this
mapping is not perfect, as the display engines don't have identical structures.
