//! Service-wide MessageHub definition.
//!
//! The service mod defines a MessageHub (and associated Address, Payload, and
//! Role namespaces) to facilitate service-wide communication. All
//! communication, both intra-component and inter-component, should be sent
//! through this hub. The address space of this MessageHub allows any component
//! to be reached when given a public address. The Role space allows granular
//! message filtering and audience targeting.
//!
//! The static Address and Role definitions below provide a way to reference
//! such values at build time. However, many use-cases that rely on these
//! features can be done through values generated at runtime instead. Care
//! should be taken before expanding either enumeration.
//!
//! Currently, service communication happens in a number of domain-specific
//! message hubs located in the internal mod. Communication from these hubs
//! should migrate here over time.
