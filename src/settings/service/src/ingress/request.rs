//! Single request handling.
//!
//! The request mod defines the components necessary for executing a single, isolated command within
//! the [Job] ecosystem. The most common work type in the setting service that fall in this category
//! are set commands where the requested action can be succinctly captured in a single request in
//! the service.
//!
//! One must define two concrete trait implementations in order to use the components of this mod.
//! The first trait is the [From] trait for [Response]. While [Response] could be broken
//! down into its contained [SettingInfo](crate::base::SettingInfo) and
//! [Error](crate::handler::base::Error) types, callers often only care about the success of a call.
//! For example, set calls typically return an empty value upon success and therefore do not
//! have a value to convert. The second trait is [Responder], which takes the first trait
//! implementation as a parameter. Ths trait allows callers to customize how the response is handled
//! with their own type as defined in the [From<Response>] trait. One should note that the
//! responder itself is passed in on the callback. This allows for the consumption of any resources
//! in the one-time use callback.
