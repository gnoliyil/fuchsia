# manifest for the test.
#
# Parameters
#
#   test_label (required)
#     The label of the host test. The template will add the "($host_toolchain)"
#     parameter.
#     Type: GN label
#   uses_expectations (optional)
#     Set to true if this test has an expectations file in the path "expectations/${target_name}.json5".
#     Type: bool
#
#   The remaining parameters are forwarded to the fuchsia_component template.
