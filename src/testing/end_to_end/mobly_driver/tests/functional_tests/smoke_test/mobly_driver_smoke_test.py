"""Mobly Driver smoke test.

This E2E smoke test exercises the Mobly Driver. Specifically, it tests the
following functionalities:

1) Execution-environment dependent logic.
2) Device config generation.
3) Mobly test execution.

The successful execution of this test in Fuchsia infra also proves the following
infra integration points:
1) Test parsing.
2) Test artifact reporting.
