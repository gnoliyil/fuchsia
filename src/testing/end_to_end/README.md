# End to end test framework

[TOC]

Lacewing is Fuchsia's python end-to-end multi-device testing framework.

This framework can be used for authoring host-driven E2E tests that interact
with 1 or more Fuchsia devices. The framework can be extended to work with
non Fuchsia devices as well.

This framework aims to provide a uniform test writing experience to all
users and exposes conveninece methods for Fuchsia device interactions that
are ergonomic and robust; with the ultimate goal of providing scriptable
host-side FIDL access to a Fuchsia device-under-test.

At a high level, the Lacewing test framework consists of three layers of
abstraction:
* Test framework - Mobly
* Device Controller - HoneyDew
* Host-Target Transport - Currently SL4F (eventually [Fuchsia Controller](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/developer/ffx/lib/fuchsia-controller/))

Why the name Lacewing? Lacewings are insects that keep the Fuchsia plant healthy
and free of harmful bugs - which is something that this framework aspires to be!

## Getting Started [30 mins]

Host tests development with the Lacewing framework is simple and fast.

* Leverages widely used Mobly test framework for standardized testbed definition
and multi-device support.
* Fuchsia device interaction logic is built in.
* Fast edit-compile-test local development workflow via `fx test`.
* Fuchsia infra integration is provided out-of-the-box given testbed exists in
lab.

The following sections walk through the local development process for a basic
single-device Lacewing test case.

### Test directory

Start by creating a test directory:

```sh
$ mkdir my_test_dir
$ cd my_test_dir
$ touch my_test.py
$ touch BUILD.gn
````

### Confirm device connection

Ensure that there's a Fuchsia device that's accessible from the host via

```sh
$ ffx target list
```

If you do not have a physical device handy, see the "Fuchsia Emulator" section
in this [README](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/testing/end_to_end/honeydew/tests/functional_tests/README.md)
to get started.

### Mobly Config YAML File

The Lacewing framework uses the open source Mobly test framework for handling
generic E2E test framework features such as testbed specification, device
initialization abstraction, assertions, and logging.

Every Mobly test requires a testbed configuration file to be provided to specify
the device(s) under test that the E2E test will need to interact with.

```sh
$ touch my_config.yaml
````

For simplicity, this is an example of a single Fuchsia device testbed.

NOTE: Multi-device testbeds follows a similar configuration but is out-of-scope
of this guide - stay tuned for the "Multi-device testing" guide.
TODO(fxbug.dev/124459)

```yaml
TestBeds:
  - Name: My_Simple_Testbed
    Controllers:
      FuchsiaDevice:
        - name: $FUCHSIA_NODENAME
          ssh_private_key: $PKEY
```

Where `$FUCHSIA_NODENAME` and `$PKEY` need to be manually substituted to fit
your local development environment.

#### `name` attribute of FuchsiaDevice
`name: $FUCHSIA_NODENAME` is the device-under-test that's accessible from the
host. A quick way to determine what this is in your local environment is to use
`ffx`:

```sh
$ ffx target list
NAME                SERIAL       TYPE                        STATE      ADDRS/IP                           RCS
fuchsia-emulator    <unknown>    workstation_eng.qemu-x64    Product    [fe80::963:275a:eeb8:2f47%qemu]    Y
```

The `$FUCSHIA_NODENAME` in the above example would be `fuchsia-emulator`.

NOTE: This may be an emulator or a physical device. If there are multiple
accessible devices, choose only the one that you'd like to target in the host
test.

#### `ssh_private_key` attribute of FuchsiaDevice
The `ssh_private_key: $PKEY` value should match the path of the SSH private key
that can be used to connect to the DUT. This is the key that pairs with the
`authorized_keys` used in paving workflows or exists in the emulator image. For
most users, this is ` ~/.ssh/fuchsia_ed25519` as it's the key used by Fuchsia's
`fx` workflows. If the DUT is provisioned by other means, you'd have to provide
the path to the corresponding SSH private key.

A quick way to confirm that Fuchsia's default SSH key works is the following:

```sh
$ fx set-device $FUCHSIA_NODENAME
$ fx shell ls
```

If the above succeeds, then the following command returns the working SSH key
path:

```sh
$ head -1 $FUCHSIA_DIR/.fx-ssh-path
```

### Lacewing test module

Every Lacewing Mobly test follows the simple scaffolding below:

```py
from fuchsia_base_test import fuchsia_base_test
from mobly import test_runner


class MyFirstLacewingTest(fuchsia_base_test.FuchsiaBaseTest):
    def setup_class(self):
        """Initialize all DUT(s)"""
        super().setup_class()
        self.fuchsia_dut = self.fuchsia_devices[0]

    def test_my_first_testcase(self):
        # Test logic goes here.
        # e.g. self.fuchsia_dut.some_api(...)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_runner.main()
```

The `self.fuchsia_dut` object contains convenient functions for common Fuchsia
device interactions. Fore more information see the
[Exploring the APIs section](#exploring-the-apis).

### Build definition

Now that you have a Lacewing test module, integrate it with the build system.


```gn
import("//build/python/python_mobly_test.gni")

python_mobly_test("my_test") {
    main_source = "my_test.py"
    # The library below provides device interaction APIs.
    libraries = [ "//src/testing/end_to_end/honeydew" ]
    local_config_source = "my_config.yaml"
}
```
### Test execution

Once the Lacewing target has been defined, you can trigger the test to run
locally via `fx test`.

Currently, there's a framework dependency on `SL4F` to be present on the Fuchsia
DUT which prevents Lacewing to work with `core` products. This constraint will
be lifted upon Lacewing's integration with [Fuchsia Controller](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/developer/ffx/lib/fuchsia-controller/).
But for now you'll have to ensure that the DUT will have the `SL4F` server
present.


```sh
$ fx set workstation_eng.x64 --with //src/testing/sl4f --with-host //path/to:my_test
$ fx test //path/to:my_test --e2e --output
```

Congrats! You've just written and run your first Lacewing test!

### Test parameters

If you'd like to pass parameters to the Lacewing test, you can do so by creating
a Mobly Test Param YAML file.

```sh
$ touch params.yaml
```

The YAML content can be in any organization structure you'd like and any common
data types:

```yaml
bool_param: True
str_param: some_string
dict_param:
  fld_1: val_1
  fld_2: val_2
list_param:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
  - 4
```

After updating the content of this file, update BUILD.gn to include it in the
`python_mobly_test()` target.

```gn
python_mobly_test("my_test") {
    ...
    params_source = "params.yaml"
    ...
}
```

Inside your Lacewing test, you can access the parameters like so:

```py
# The params are accessible from any test methods with access to `self`as well,
# not just in setup related methods.
def setup_class(self):
    ...
    my_bool_param = self.user_params["bool_param"]
    my_list_param = self.user_params["list_param"]
    ...
```

### Test output

If your test generates artifacts, it is recommended that you do so under the
`self.log_path` directory.

Similar to `self.user_params`, this is a framework-provided variable that can be
accessed at any point during the test. Storing your output under this directory
will ensure your test and its output integrates well if it's ever run in Fuchsia
infra.

```py
my_artifact_path = os.path.join(self.log_path, 'my_artifact')
with open(my_artifact_path, 'w+', encoding="utf8") as file_handle:
    file_handle.write('data')
```

### Exploring the APIs

After creating your first Lacewing test, it's time to add the test logic that
will perform all of the interesting host-device-interactions.

The Lacewing framework comes with its built-in API for mediating interactions
with Fuchsia devices.

See the [Honeydew README.md](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/testing/end_to_end/honeydew/README.md) to learn more.

### Existing test examples

See [examples](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/testing/end_to_end/examples/) for working examples of existing Lacewing tests.
