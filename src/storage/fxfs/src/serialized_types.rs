//! # On-disk versioning
//!
//! This module manages serialization and deserialization of FxFS structures to disk.
//!
//! In FxFS, on-disk layout is deferred to serialization libraries (i.e.
//! [bincode](https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode#is-bincode-suitable-for-storage), serde).
//! Stability of these layouts depends on both struct/enum stability and serialization libraries.
//!
//! This module provides struct/enum stability by maintaining a generation of types and a
//! means to upgrade from older versions to newer ones.
//!
//! The trait mechanism used is flexible enough to allow specific versions to use differing
//! serialization code if we ever require it.
//!
//! ## Traits
//!
//! All serialization is done with serde so [Serialize] and [Deserialize] traits must be derived
//! for all types and sub-types.
//!
//! All versioned, serializable struct/enum type should have the [Versioned] trait.
//! The most recent version of a type should also have the [VersionedLatest] trait.
//! These traits are largely implemented for you via the `versioned_type!` macro as follows:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! versioned_type! {
//!   3.. => SuperBlockHeaderV3,
//!   2.. => SuperBlockHeaderV2,
//!   1.. => SuperBlockHeaderV1,
//! }
//!
//! // Note the reuse of SuperBlockRecordV1 for two versions.
//! versioned_type! {
//!   3.. => SuperBlockRecordV2,
//!   1.. => SuperBlockRecordV1,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The user is required to implement [From] to migrate from one version to the next.
//! The above macros will implement further [From] traits allowing direct upgrade from any version
//! to the latest. [VersionedLatest] provides a `deserialize_from_version` method that can be
//! used to deserialize any supported version and then upgrade it to the latest format.
//!
//! ## Conventions
//!
//! There are limits to how automated this process can be, so we rely heavily on conventions.
//!
//!  * Every versioned type should have a monotonically increasing `Vn` suffix for each generation.
//!  * Every versioned sub-type (e.g. child of a struct) should also have `Vn` suffix.
//!  * In type definitions, all versioned child types should be referred to explicitly with their
//!    `Vn` suffix. This prevents us from accidentally changing a version by changing a sub-type.
