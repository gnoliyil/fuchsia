// Stubs out some Fxfs-specific capabilities.  This helps satisfy static routing checks for targets
// which depend on these Fxfs-specific capabilities (although any attempted use of the capabilities
// will result in a hang).  This is subpar because it means we don't get the benefits of the static
// routing checks, but component manifests aren't sufficiently expressive and integrated with the
// build system to avoid this (since we can't have "optional" intermediate routing hops very
// easily, see https://fxbug.dev/107231).
//
// Besides, all of this should go away if and when we standardize the platform on Fxfs.
