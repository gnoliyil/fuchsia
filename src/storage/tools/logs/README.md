# Extracting logs on zedboot and bringup

For tests which run emulators without networking, we need a way to extract logs from the device
that is more consistent than serial. These tools provide that way.

The first tool, run-with-logs, is a Fuchsia binary which takes a path to a block device and a
command line invocation as an argument, and runs the command line invocation, reading the stdout
and stderr and then writing it to the block device in a simple format.

The second tool, extract-logs, is a host binary which takes a path to a file and locations to write
stdout and stderr to, and extracts the logs from the file.
