//
// Held by a unique_ptr<> in the OperationContainer. Instances of derived
// classes need to be created with |std::make_unique|.
//
// Advantages of using an Operation instance to implement asynchronous fidl
// method invocations:
//
//  1. To receive the return callback, the interface pointer on which the method
//     is invoked needs to be kept around. It's tricky to place a move-only
//     interface pointer on the capture list of a lambda passed as argument to
//     its own method. An instance is much simpler.
//
//  2. The capture list of the callbacks only holds this, everything else that
//     needs to be passed on is in the instance.
//
//  3. Conversion of Handle to Ptr can be done by Bind() because the Ptr is
//     already there.
//
// Use of Operation instances must adhere to invariants:
//
// * Deleting the operation container deletes all Operation instances in it, and
//   it must be guaranteed that no callbacks of ongoing method invocations are
//   invoked after the Operation instance they access is deleted. In order to
//   accomplish this, an Operation instance must only invoke methods on fidl
//   pointers that are either owned by the Operation instance, or that are owned
//   by the immediate owner of the operation container. This way, when the
//   operation container is deleted, the destructors of all involved fidl
//   pointers are called, close their channels, and cancel all pending method
//   callbacks. If a method is invoked on a fidl pointer that lives on beyond
//   the lifetime of the operation container, this is not guaranteed.

// in case the external service misbehaves and doesn't respond.

// In that situation, it would be wrong to place two copies of the flow token on
// the capture list of both callbacks, because then the flow would only be
// Done() once both callbacks are destroyed. In the case where the second
// callback is a timeout, this might be really late.
//
// Instead, a single copy of the flow token is placed in a shared container, a
// reference to which is placed on the capture list of both callbacks. The first
// callback that is invoked removes the flow token from the shared container and
// propagates it from there.
//
// That way, the flow token in the shared container also acts as call-once flag.
//
// The flow token holder is a simple wrapper of a shared ptr to a unique ptr. We
// define it because such a nested smart pointer is rather unwieldy to write
// every time.

//   FlowTokenHolder branch{flow};
