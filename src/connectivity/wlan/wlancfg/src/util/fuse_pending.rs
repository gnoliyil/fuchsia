/// `Stream`s should indicate their termination by returning an item of `Poll::Ready(None)`.
/// Once a Stream terminated it is generally not safe to poll the Stream any longer.
/// Support for safely polling already terminated Streams is provided by the `Fuse` wrapper.
/// The wrapper only polls not yet terminated Streams. If the underlying Stream already terminated
/// Fuse immediately returns `Poll::Ready(None)` without further polling its wrapped Stream.
/// Some Streams never terminate, such as `FuturesOrdered`. To indicate that there is currently
/// no work scheduled, these Streams return `Poll::Ready(None)`. However, when these Streams are
/// used in combination with Fuse the Streams would get polled once and immediately declared to have
/// terminated due to their return value oof `Poll::Ready(None)`. Instead, such Streams should
/// return `Poll::Pending`. `FusePending` provides this mapping.
/// Note: This wrapper should only be used if the underlying Stream defined its behavior if no
/// work is scheduled. Usually, such Streams are expected to never terminate.
