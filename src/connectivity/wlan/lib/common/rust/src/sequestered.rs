// TODO(fxbug.dev/116570): This type should not derive `PartialEq`. Though it only allows trivial
//                         observation (i.e., "is this black box the same as that black box?"),
//                         that is observation nonetheless and client code could foreseeably branch
//                         based on this query. It is implemented to ease the implementation of
//                         tests, where assertions of equality are ubiquitous.
/// Isolates data such that it is inaccessible without explicitly releasing it.
///
/// Sequestered data cannot be directly read nor written while contained (though it can be
/// trivially replaced). This is useful for data that must be "ferried" through a system but should
/// not generally be examined nor inspected, in particular when inspection of the data would
/// otherwise seem innocuous but implicitly violates a design contract or introduces an unwanted
/// data dependency.
///
/// **This type cannot completely prevent reads and writes.** Rather, it makes reads and writes
/// very explicit and more obvious in order to avoid mistakes in data APIs.
///
/// Sequestering data is trivial and is done via the core `From` and `Into` traits. Releasing data
/// is intentionally more explicit and requires the use of fully-qualified syntax that names the
/// `Sequestered` type.
///
/// As sequestered data is considered a "black box", `Sequestered` only implements the `Clone` and
/// `Debug` traits (so long as the type `T` provides implementations). Note that `Copy` is not
/// implemented, because releasing data would not be strictly affine and data could be implicitly
/// copied out of fields via `release`. This is not only implicit, but can be counterintuitive in
/// some contexts, because `release` moves a copy of the `Sequestered`.
///
/// `Sequestered` also implements `PartialEq` largely for testing. See fxbug.dev/116570.
