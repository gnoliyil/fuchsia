//! Event handling and composition for interacting with the WLAN tap driver.
//!
//! This module provides APIs for writing tests that must handle and interact with events from the
//! WLAN tap driver. The primary mechanism for this are event handlers, which can be composed in
//! sophisticated ways to route and act upon events. The hardware simulator test harness forwards
//! events into these handlers.
//!
//! Event handlers are described by the [`Handler`] trait. Much like the standard [`Iterator`]
//! trait, [`Handler`] is composable. Event handlers are constructed by composing [`Handler`]s
//! together via combinators. [`Handler`] has many associated functions that are analogous to those
//! found in [`Iterator`], [`Option`], and [`Result`] and follows many of the same patterns. The
//! execution of handlers and routing of events is largely controlled by whether or not handlers
//! match an event: see [`Handled`], which resembles [`Option`].
//!
//! The primary method of the [`Handler`] trait is [`call`][`Handler::call`], which accepts an
//! exclusive reference to state and a shared reference to an event and must react to this event
//! and return a [`Handled`] that describes whether or not the event was matched and, if so, what
//! the output is.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! [`Handler`] combinators can be used to construct complex event handlers in a declarative way.
//! The following non-trivial example constructs an event handler that examines the status code of
//! an association response frame. The handler also enforces ordering: action frames may arrive at
//! any time, but any other management frame must follow the association response frame.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let mut handler = event::on_transmit(branch::or(( // Only handle transmit events.
//!     event::extract(|_: Buffered<ActionFrame<false>>| {}), // Allow (ignore) action frames...
//!     event::until_first_match(branch::or(( // ...or match only once.
//!         event::extract(|frame: Buffered<AssocRespFrame>| { // Examine response frames...
//!             let frame = frame.get();
//!             assert_eq!(
//!                 { frame.assoc_resp_hdr.status_code },
//!                 fidl_ieee80211::StatusCode::Success.into(),
//!             );
//!         })
//!         .and(event::once(|_, _| sender.send(()).unwrap())), // ...and send a completion signal...
//!         event::extract(|_: Buffered<MgmtFrame>| {
//!             panic!("unexpected management frame"); // ...or panic if a management frame arrives instead.
//!         }),
//!     ))),
//! )));
//! ```
//!
//! See existing tests for more examples of constructing event handlers.
