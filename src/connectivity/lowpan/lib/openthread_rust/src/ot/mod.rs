//! # OpenThread API Module #
//!
//! This module contains (mostly) type-safe versions of the OpenThread API,
//! excluding the platform API.
//!
//! ## Type Safety ##
//!
//! Full type safety for an API which wasn't created for type safety is hard. There are some
//! operations which feel like they should be fully safe but are ultimately marked as `unsafe`
//! because it might be possible to abuse in some way that causes undefined behavior.
//!
//! ## Types ##
//!
//! Each enum, struct, or object in the OpenThread C API is associated with a safe Rust
//! equivalent. For example:
//!
//! * [`otInstance`](crate::otsys::otInstance): [`ot::Instance`](Instance).
//! * [`otMessage`](crate::otsys::otMessage): [`ot::Message<'_>`](Message).
//! * [`otError`](crate::otsys::otError): [`ot::Error`](Error) or [`Result`].
//!
//! ## Ownership ##
//!
//! Some OpenThread API objects, like [`otsys::otInstance`](crate::otsys::otInstance) and
//! [`otsys::otMessage`](crate::otsys::otMessage) have hidden implementations and explicit ownership
//! transfer. That means we must have a notation which is capable of both "owned" instances
//! and "borrowed" references.
//!
//! The rust equivalent of passing around a pointer to one of thse
//! objects would be to pass around a reference: `otInstance*` becomes a `&ot::Instance`.
//! Owned instances are "boxed" into a [`ot::Box`](Box), so an owned `otInstance*` would become
//! a `ot::Box<ot::Instance>`, or a [`OtInstanceBox`](crate::OtInstanceBox) for short. When the box
//! goes out of scope, the appropriate OpenThread C finalization API is called.
//!
//! ## Singleton/Multiple OpenThread Instances ##
//!
//! OpenThread can be compiled to either only support a singleton instance or to support
//! multiple independent OpenThread instances.
//!
//! Currently, this crate only supports a singleton OpenThread instance. Attempting to create
//! more than one OpenThread instance at a time will result in a runtime panic.
//!
//! ## Traits ##
//!
//! The OpenThread API is broken down into "modules" of functionality containing types and
//! related methods. Similarly, this Rust interface breaks down functionality into traits.
//! This allows parts of the OpenThread API to be substituted with mocked versions for unit
//! testing.
//!
//! ## Callbacks ##
//!
//! In most cases, you register a callback by passing a closure to the appropriate callback
//! registration API.
//!
//! ## Platform Implementations ##
//!
//! This crate doesn't directly provide the platform implementations for OpenThreadâ€”that
//! needs to come from either a separate library or the program which is using this crate.
//!
