# Ganerates a table comparing Netstack2 and Netstack3 syscall and socket test
# expectations.
#
# Usage:
#
# This script is called without arguments. It requires communication with a
# Fuchsia target device to extract test case names and expectations. It uses
# `fx` commands to achieve that.
#
# The tool outputs a CSV table to stdout where the first column is the test
# name, second column is Netstack2 expectation, and third column is Netstack3
# expectation.

# Logs inputs to stderr.
log() { echo "$@" 1>&2; }

# Gets the full URL for a test component target.
#
# Arguments
#  - Test name as passed to fx test.

# COMPONENT.
#
# Arguments
#  - Fully qualified fuchsia package URL for a test COMPONENT.

# Reads expectations JSON for a test.
#
# Arguments
#  - Fully qualified fuchsia package URL for the PACKAGE containing the test.
#  - Path to expectations file relative to package root.
