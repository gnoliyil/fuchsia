//! The transport layer.
//!
//! # Listeners and connections
//!
//! Some transport layer protocols (notably TCP and UDP) follow a common pattern
//! with respect to registering listeners and connections. There are some
//! subtleties here that are worth pointing out.
//!
//! ## Connections
//!
//! A connection has simpler semantics than a listener. It is bound to a single
//! local address and port and a single remote address and port. By virtue of
//! being bound to a local address, it is also bound to a local interface. This
//! means that, regardless of the entries in the forwarding table, all traffic
//! on that connection will always egress over the same interface. [^1] This
//! also means that, if the interface's address changes, any connections bound
//! to it are severed.
//!
//! ## Listeners
//!
//! A listener, on the other hand, can be bound to any number of local addresses
//! (although it is still always bound to a particular port). From the
//! perspective of this crate, there are two ways of registering a listener:
//! - By specifying one or more local addresses, the listener will be bound to
//!   each of those local addresses.
//! - By specifying zero local addresses, the listener will be bound to all
//!   addresses. These are referred to in our documentation as "wildcard
//!   listeners".
//!
//! The algorithm for figuring out what listener to deliver a packet to is as
//! follows: If there is any listener bound to the specific local address and
//! port addressed in the packet, deliver the packet to that listener.
//! Otherwise, if there is a wildcard listener bound the port addressed in the
//! packet, deliver the packet to that listener. This implies that if a listener
//! is removed which was bound to a particular local address, it can "uncover" a
//! wildcard listener bound to the same port, allowing traffic which would
//! previously have been delivered to the normal listener to now be delivered to
//! the wildcard listener.
//!
//! If desired, clients of this crate can implement a different mechanism for
//! registering listeners on all local addresses - enumerate every local
//! address, and then specify all of the local addresses when registering the
//! listener. This approach will not support shadowing, as a different listener
//! binding to the same port will explicitly conflict with the existing
//! listener, and will thus be rejected. In other words, from the perspective of
//! this crate's API, such listeners will appear like normal listeners that just
//! happen to bind all of the addresses, rather than appearing like wildcard
//! listeners.
//!
//! [^1]: It is an open design question as to whether incoming traffic on the
//!       connection will be accepted from a different interface. This is part
//!       of the "weak host model" vs "strong host model" discussion.
