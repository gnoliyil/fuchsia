//! Execution contexts.
//!
//! This module defines "context" traits, which allow code in this crate to be
//! written agnostic to their execution context.
//!
//! All of the code in this crate operates in terms of "events". When an event
//! occurs (for example, a packet is received, an application makes a request,
//! or a timer fires), a function is called to handle that event. In response to
//! that event, the code may wish to emit new events (for example, to send a
//! packet, to respond to an application request, or to install a new timer).
//! The traits in this module provide the ability to emit new events. For
//! example, if, in order to handle some event, we need the ability to install
//! new timers, then the function to handle that event would take a
//! [`TimerContext`] parameter, which it could use to install new timers.
//!
//! Structuring code this way allows us to write code which is agnostic to
//! execution context - a test fake or any number of possible "real-world"
//! implementations of these traits all appear as indistinguishable, opaque
//! trait implementations to our code.
//!
//! The benefits are deeper than this, though. Large units of code can be
//! subdivided into smaller units that view each other as "contexts". For
//! example, the ARP implementation in the [`crate::device::arp`] module defines
//! the [`ArpContext`] trait, which is an execution context for ARP operations.
//! It is implemented both by the test fakes in that module, and also by the
//! Ethernet device implementation in the [`crate::device::ethernet`] module.
//!
//! This subdivision of code into small units in turn enables modularity. If,
//! for example, the IP code sees transport layer protocols as execution
//! contexts, then customizing which transport layer protocols are supported is
//! just a matter of providing a different implementation of the transport layer
//! context traits (this isn't what we do today, but we may in the future).
