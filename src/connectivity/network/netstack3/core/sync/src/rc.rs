//! Synchronized reference counting primitives.
//!
//! This module introduces a family of reference counted types that allows
//! marking the underlying data for destruction before all strongly references
//! to the data are dropped. This enables the following features:
//!   * Upgrading a weak reference to a strong reference succeeds iff at least
//!     one strong reference exists _and_ the data has not been marked for
//!     destruction.
//!   * Allow waiting for all strongly-held references to be dropped after
//!     marking the data. (TODO: https://fxbug.dev/122388).
