// entries that can be in one of three states:
// - queued: entries describing buffers already operated on, queued to be sent
// to the driver (populated buffers for Tx, already processed buffers for Rx).
// - in-flight: entries describing buffers currently owned by the driver, not
// yet returned.
// - ready: entries describing buffers retrieved from the driver, but not yet
// operated on (free unpopulated buffers for Tx, buffers containing inbound
// traffic for Rx).
