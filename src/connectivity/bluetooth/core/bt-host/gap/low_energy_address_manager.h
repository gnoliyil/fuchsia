// Manages the local LE device address used in scan, legacy advertising, and
// connection initiation procedures. The primary purpose of this class is to
// defer updating the random device address if we believe that doing so is
// disallowed by the controller. This is the case when scanning or legacy
// advertising is enabled, according to the Core Spec v5.3, Vol 4, Part E,
// 7.8.4.
//
// Procedures that need to know the value of the local address (both connection
// and advertising procedures need to assign this to any resultant
// hci::Connection object for SMP pairing to function correctly) should call the
// EnsureLocalAddress() method to obtain it and to lazily refresh the address
// if required.
//
// The type and value of the local address depends on whether or not the privacy
// feature is in use. The potential states are as follows:
//
//   * When privacy is DISABLED, the local address type and its value match
//     the public device address that this object gets initialized with.
//
//   * When privacy is ENABLED, the exact type and value depends on the state of
//     link layer procedures at that time. The "HCI LE Set Random Address"
//     command is used to assign the controller a random address, which it will
//     use for the next active scan, legacy advertising, or initiation command
//     with a random address type. A new local random address will be generated
//     at a regular interval (see kPrivateAddressTimeout in gap.h).
//
//     According to Vol 2, Part E, 7.8.4 the "HCI LE Set Random Address"
//     command is disallowed when scanning or legacy advertising are enabled.
//     Before any one of these procedures gets started, the EnsureLocalAddress()
//     method should be called to update the random address if it is allowed by
//     the controller (and the address needs a refresh). This function
//     asynchronously returns the device address that should be used by the
//     procedure.
//
// The state requested by EnablePrivacy() (enabled or disabled) may not take
// effect immediately if a scan, advertising, or connection procedure is in
// progress. The requested address type (public or private) will apply
// eventually when the controller allows it.
