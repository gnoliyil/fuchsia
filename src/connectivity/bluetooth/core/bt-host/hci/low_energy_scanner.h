  //     started, e.g. because discovery is already in progress, or it is in the
  //     process of being stopped, or the controller does not support discovery,
  //     etc.
  //
  //   - Synchronously returns true if the procedure was initiated but the it is
  //     unknown whether or not the procedure has succeeded.
  //
  //   - |callback| is invoked asynchronously to report the status of the
  //     procedure. In the case of failure, |callback| will be invoked once to
  //     report the end of the procedure. In the case of success, |callback|
  //     will be invoked twice: the first time to report that the procedure has
  //     started, and a second time to report when the procedure ends, either
  //     due to a timeout or cancellation.
  //
  //   - |period| specifies (in milliseconds) the duration of the scan. If the
  //     special value of kPeriodInfinite is passed then scanning will continue
  //     indefinitely and must be explicitly stopped by calling StopScan().
  //     Otherwise, the value must be non-zero.
  //
  // Once started, a scan can be terminated at any time by calling the
  // StopScan() method. Otherwise, an ongoing scan will terminate at the end of
  // the scan period if a finite value for |period| was provided.
  //
  // During an active scan, scannable advertisements are reported alongside their
  // corresponding scan response. Every scannable advertisement is stored and not
  // reported until either
  //   a) a scan response is received
  //   b) an implementation determined timeout period expires
  //   c) for periodic scans, when the scan period expires
  //
  // Since a passive scan involves no scan request/response, all advertisements are
  // reported immediately without waiting for a scan response.
