///
/// To elaborate: This implementation is implied by the nature of _applicative functors_, which are
/// a class of types that support 'tupling' of their type members. In particular, Functions, Tuples,
/// Futures and Results are all applicative, and compositions of applicatives are _also_ applicative
/// by definition. So a `Function that returns a Result of a Tuple` is applicative (e.g. `init()`),
/// as is a `Function that returns a Future of a Result` (such as `terminate()`).
///
/// A TestHarness impl itself is really equivalent to a tuple of two functions - init() and
/// terminate(). Again, by the composition of applicative functors, this itself is applicative, and
/// therefore a tuple of TestHarness impls can be turned into an TestHarness impl of a tuple. Rustc
/// isn't able to derive this automatically for us so we write this macro here to do the heavy
/// lifting.
///
/// (Further caveat: The tupling of terminate() is technically slightly more complex as it's a
/// function indexed by a type parameter (Self::Env), but it still shakes out much the same)
