# Bluetooth Profile: Hands-Free Profile Audio Gateway (AG)

This component implements the Audio Gateway role of Hands-Free Profile (HFP) version 1.8 as
specified by the Bluetooth SIG in the
[official specification](https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=489628).

This means that you can use your Fuchsia device to connect with Bluetooth to a headset with speakers
and microphone that supports the Hands-Free role. Audio data is streamed between the two devices
in real-time to support interactive voice calls.

HFP includes support for user-initiated actions on the Hands-Free device, such as answering calls,
hanging up calls, and volume control. See the specification for a complete list of functionality.

## Build Configuration

Add the following to your Fuchsia set configuration to include the profile component:

`--with //src/connectivity/bluetooth/profiles/bt-hfp-audio-gateway`

### Profile Startup

Component startup differs based on the component framework version.

#### Component Framework v2

Currently, the only way to start the v2 component is via protocol discovery. Include the appropriate
`core_shard` in your product config target. For configurations in which HFP AG support is desired,
include the `bt-hfp-audio-gateway-core-shard`. For testonly configurations, include the
`bt-hfp-audio-gateway-for-testing-core-shard`.

When the `fuchsia.bluetooth.hfp.Hfp` FIDL capability is requested, the CFv2 HFP AG component will be
started.

## Running tests

HFP relies on unit tests to validate behavior. Add the following to your Fuchsia set configuration
to include the profile unit tests:

`--with //src/connectivity/bluetooth/profiles/bt-hfp-audio-gateway:bt-hfp-audio-gateway-tests`

To run the tests:

```
fx test bt-hfp-audio-gateway-tests
```

## Inspect

The `bt-hfp-audio-gateway` component includes support for
[component inspection](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/diagnostics/inspect). To view
the current state of the component, use `ffx inspect show core/bt-hfp-audio-gateway`.
