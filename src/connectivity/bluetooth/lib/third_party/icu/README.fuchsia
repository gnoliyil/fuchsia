Description:
TODO(fxbug.dev/86742): Evaluate whether we can remove this library and use
//third_party/icu instead.

This file has the relevant components from ICU copied to handle basic
UTF8/16/32 conversions. Components are copied from utf.h utf8.h utf16.h and
utf_impl.c

The same module appears in third_party/icu, so we don't repeat the license
file here.

The main change is that U_/U8_/U16_ prefixes have been replaced with
BT_LIB_U_/BT_LIB_U8_/BT_LIB_U16_ to avoid confusion with the "real" ICU macros should ICU
be in use on the system. For the same reason, the functions and types have been
put in the "bt_icu" namespace.
