namespace zxdb {

namespace {

const char kExpressionsName[] = "expressions";
const char kExpressionsHelp[] = R"*(Expressions

  Expressions appear in many commands. Some commands expect just an expression,
  most notably "print":

    [zxdb] print &object->array_data[i + 4]
    (*)71cc72b5310

  Other commands such as "break" or "disassemble" accept a location. This is
  typically a function name or a line number, but can also be an expression that
  evaluates to a memory address. To use expressions for these commands, prefix
  it with a "*":

    [zxdb] break *foo->some_address
    Created Breakpoint 1 @ 0x30ad01a2b80

  Most C++ and Rust operators are implemented in a language-compatible way.
  Function calls are not currently supported (with exceptions, see "Pretty
  printers" below). User-overloaded operators are ignored.

Variable and type names

  Names are evaluated in the current context according to C++ rules. This means
  that zxdb will search the current frame's local variables, function
  parameters, variables on "this" and its base-classes, variables in the current
  namespace and enclosing namespace.

  Type names are handled similarly, so type names used in casts need not specify
  namespaces or class names if the current frame is in that namespace or class.

  However, template parameters in type names must match exactly with the names
  in the symbol file. This includes all namespaces and, critically for C++ STL,
  all optional template parameters like allocator names.

  It is not currently possible to refer to types and statics defined locally to
  a function when the current scope is outside that function.

Casting

  The following casts are supported in a C++-compatible way:

    • (Foo*)0x1234567
    • reinterpret_cast<Foo*>(bar)
    • static_cast<int>(foo)

  Unlike in C++, const has no effect in the debugger so there is no const_cast.

  In Rust, use normal "as" syntax for casting.

Arrays

  In C/C++, you can specify the size of an array using the syntax "array@size".
  This allows printing the array values corresponding to a pointer or for a
  flexible array member at the end of a structure.

    [zxdb] print argv           # Normal pointer interpretation of char**.
    (*)0x1e88d07bfc0 ➔ "/pkg/bin/foo"

    [zxdb] print argv@3         # Declare array of size 3.
    {"/pkg/bin/foo", "--bar", "baz"}

Control flow

  The expression system can instatiate new local (local to the debugger)
  variables and control flow commands. This is mostly useful in the context of
  writing logic for pretty-printers (currently internal only).

  Local variables can be instantiated in the normal language-specific way but
  are only valid for the duration of the current "print" command. In C++, the
  use of "auto" is encouraged to simplify casting:

    [zxdb] print auto i = 45; i * 100
    4500

  In addition to the C ternary if (?:) statement, C and Rust if/else statements
  are also supported. Since the expression language is dynamically typed,
  everything is an expression and has a value. The last statement of a block
  always determines the result value of that block. The result of loops and
  untaken if statements is an empty but valid value.

    [zxdb] print if (a == 5) { a * 10; }
    50

  In Rust, you can extract the values of an enum (though not yet enum structs
  with named members) using "if let" (this does not require an "else" arm as
  Rust does, since the result in that case will be an empty value):

    [zxdb] print if let Some(x) = my_enum { x }

  In C++, non-range-based-"for", "do/while", and "while" loops are supported. In
  Rust, "loop" and "while" loops are supported (Rust "for" loops use iterators
  which the debugger can not instantiate).

  For example, to count the number of slashes in the argv[0] string, one could
  type (all on one line):

    [zxdb] p int count = 0; char* cur = argv[0]; while (*cur) {
      if (*cur == '/') { count = count + 1; } cur = cur + 1; } count

Special names

  Special names begin with '$'. There are different forms:

  Escaped strings: "$(...)"

      Sometimes there are symbol names that can't be parsed in the standard
      language. This especially applies to compiler-generated symbols. Enclose
      such strings in "$(...)". Parens inside the escaped contents can be
      literal as long as they're balanced, otherwise, escape them by preceeding
      with a backslash. Include a literal backslash with two blackslashes:

        $(something with spaces)
        $({{impl}})
        $(some_closure(data))
        $(line\)noise\\)

  Register names: "$reg(...)"

      To unambiguously refer to register names, use the "$reg" annotation. So on
      x64 "$reg(rax)" or "$reg(xmm0)".

  Main function: "$main"

      Maps to the entrypoint declared in the symbols, and falls back on the
      function named "main" if there is no entrypoint defined.

  ELF symbols: "$elf(...)" "$plt(...)"

      Maps to symbols from the ELF file. "$elf" matches all ELF symbols, "$plt"
      matches only symbols in the Procedure Linkage Table (used for jumping to
      dynamically linked functions in other shared libraries).

CPU registers

  The expression evaluator will check for register names if there is no variable
  with a given string. So in most cases you can just use literal register names:

    [zxdb] print rax

  Unambiguously refer to CPU registers using the form "$reg(rax)" as discussed
  above under "Special names".

  Vector registers are interpreted according to the current vector-format option
  (see "get vector-format" for possibilities, and "set vector-format <new_mode>"
  to set). They will be converted to arrays of the extracted values. Array
  notation can be used to refer to individual values. Using "double" vector
  format on a 128-bit ARM "v6" register would give:

    [zxdb] print v6
    {0.0, 3.14}

    [zxdb] print $reg(v6)
    {0.0, 3.14}

    [zxdb] print $reg(v6)[1]
    3.14

    [zxdb] print $v6[0] = 2.71    # Assignment to a vector sub-value.
    2.71

  Importantly, since they are arrays, vector registers used in expressions print
  the 0th element first and increase to the right. This can be surprising
  because it's traditional to show vector registers with the high order bits on
  the left and indices decreasing to the right. Use the "regs" command for a
  vector-specific presentation if you want this format.

Pretty printers

  The debugger's pretty-printing system formats objects with complex internal
  definitions to be presented in a way that the user expects. This system also
  provides pretend data members, array access, and member functions for
  expressions so these objects behave as expected.

  The pretend functions are implemented internally in the debugger as
  expressions rather than executing any code in the debugged process. Only
  getters that take no arguments are currently supported.

  For example, vector- and string-like objects can be indexed with "[ <index> ]"
  and in C++ you can call back(), capacity(), empty(), front(), size(), and in
  Rust you can call as_ptr(), as_mut_ptr(), capacity(), is_empty(), len().

    [zxdb] print some_std_vector.size()
    5

    [zxdb] print some_std_vector[2]
    42

  Smart pointer, optional, and variant object can be dereferenced with "*" and
  "->" operators.

    [zxdb] print some_optional
    std::optional({x = 5, y = 1})

    [zxdb] print *some_optional
    {x = 5, y = 1}

    [zxdb] print some_optional->x
    5

Common errors

  <Optimized out>
      Indicates that the program symbols declare a variable with the given name,
      but that it has no value or location. This means the compiler has entirely
      optimized out the variable and the debugger can not show it. If you need
      to see it, use a less-optimized build setting.

  <Unavailable>
      Indicates that the variable is not valid at the current address, but that
      its value is known at other addresses. In optimized code, the compiler
      will often re-use registers, clobbering previous values which become
      unavailable.

      You can see the valid ranges for a variable with the "sym-info" command:

        [zxdb] sym-info my_variable

      Under "DWARF location" it will give a list of address ranges where the
      value of the variable is known (inclusive at the beginning of the range,
      non-inclusive at the end). Run to one of these addresses to see the value
      of the variable (use "di" to see the current address).

      You can ignore the "DWARF expression bytes" which are the internal
      instructions for finding the variable.

constexpr char kJitdName[] = "jitd";
constexpr char kJitdHelp[] = R"(Just In Time Debugging

  Just In Time Debugging is a way for the system to suspend processes that have
  crashed without any exception handlers. The system will keep those processes
  in a place called "Process Limbo". Later, zxdb will automatically connect to
  Process Limbo and attach to all processes waiting to be debugged.

Enabling process limbo in the system

  To enable catching exceptions in newly crashed processes, use:

    ffx debug limbo enable

  For full documentation on enabling and configuring Limbo, including enabling
  on system startup, see the full documentation at:

  https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/debugging/just_in_time_debugging

Listing Processes

  When zxdb starts up, any process waiting to be debugged within Process Limbo
  will be listed like this:

    👉 To get started, try "status" or "help".
    Processes auto attached from limbo:
      4938729: process-that-crashed
      4940432: some-other-process-that-crashed
    Type "detach <pid>" to send back to Process Limbo (unattached) or type
    "process <process context #> kill" to exit the process.
    ...
    [zxdb]


  You can also run the "status" command to see the currently attached processes:

    [zxdb] status
    Connection
      Connected to '/tmp/debug_agent_ZdPZdx.socket' on port 0.

    Filters
      Newly launched processes matching a filter will be automatically attached.

      There are no filters. Use "attach <process-name>" to create one.

    Processes
      Attached to 2 process(es). The debugger has these:
        # State      Koid Name
        1 Running 4938729 process-that-crashed
      ▶ 2 Running 4940432 some-other-process-that-crashed

    Processes waiting on exception
      No processes waiting on exception.

Attaching/Removing Processes

  From the point of view of zxdb, processes in limbo behave very similar to what
  a normal running process does. In order to start debugging one, simply start
  zxdb like normal and zxdb will retrieve the process from limbo and start
  debugging it. Once attached, you can manipulate the process as normal, and
  even detach or kill it.

  Note that if you detach from a crashing process, the exception will be
  re-triggered and it will caught by Process Limbo. Killing it will terminate
  the process as usual. A notice will be displayed to communicate when a process
  that has previously crashed crashes again. Such a process found to crash
  multiple times will not automatically attach, but can still be attached with
  the regular attach command i.e. "attach <KOID>".

  The only difference comes when attempting to release a process from Process
  Limbo, without attaching to it. In that case, you need to instruct the
  debugger to "detach" from it by issuing a "detach <KOID>" command. You can
  also explicitly kill such a process with "pr <process context #> kill". Using
  the example above, use "pr 2 kill" to kill the process named
  "some-other-process-that-crashed".

  The default setting to automatically attach to all processes in Process Limbo
  can be overridden via the -n switch or --no-auto-attach-limbo when invoking
  "ffx debug connect" or interactively with "set auto-attach-limbo" at the
  [zxdb] prompt.
