// Represents the stack of a thread that's suspended or blocked in an exception. If a thread is
// running, blocked (not in an exception), or in any other state, the stack frames are not
// available.
//
// EMPTY, PARTIAL AND COMPLETE STACKS
// ----------------------------------
// When a thread is suspended or blocked in an exception, it will UNUSUALLY have its top frame
// available (the current IP and stack position) and the next (the calling frame) if possible.
//
// Sometimes a thread might have an empty stack (and hence no current location) from an exception.
// This is because exceptions are delivered from the kernel asynchronously, and by the time an
// exception is handled in the debug agent, the thread may have been killed. This will result in
// failred register reads for the thread and no stack or location. Code should never assume there
// are any stack frames.
//
// If the full backtrace is needed, SyncFrames() can be called which will compute the full backtrace
// and issue the callback when complete. This backtrace will be cached until the thread is resumed.
//
// INLINE FRAMES
// -------------
// The thread's current position can be in multiple inline frames at the same time (the first
// address of an inline function is both the first instruction of that function, and the virtual
// "call" of that function in the outer frame). This only applies to the topmost set of inline
// frames since anything below the first physical frame is unambiguous).
//
// To make stepping work as expected, code can adjust which of these ambiguous inline frames the
// stack reports is the top, and inline frames above that are hidden from the normal size() and
// operator[] functions.
