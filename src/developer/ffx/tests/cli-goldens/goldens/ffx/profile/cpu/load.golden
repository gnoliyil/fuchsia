    "1) To measure the CPU load over a two second duration:\n\n    $ ffx profile cpu load --duration 2s\n\n    The measured CPU load from each core is printed in the following format:\n\n        CPU 0: 0.66%\n        CPU 1: 1.56%\n        CPU 2: 0.83%\n        CPU 3: 0.71%\n        Total: 3.76%\n\n    The valid range for each CPU load is [0-100]%. The \"Total\" value represents the summation of the load percentages of all CPU cores and is valid in the range [0-100*[NUM_CPU]]%.\n\n2) To log CPU load every 500 ms indefinitely:\n\n    $ ffx profile cpu load start --interval 500ms\n\n    Logged samples will be available via iquery under core/metrics-logger and via tracing in the `cpu_usage` category.\n\n3) To log CPU load every 1 second for 30 seconds with output-to-syslog enabled:\n\n    $ ffx profile cpu load start --interval 1s -d 30s --output-to-syslog\n\n    Logged samples will be available in syslog, via iquery under core/metrics-logger and via tracing in the `cpu_usage` category.\n"
