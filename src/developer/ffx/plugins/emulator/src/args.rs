    note = "The emu command is used to start up, manage, and shut down Fuchsia emulators.

The `start` subcommand launches an emulator according to the configuration in
the Product Bundle. Once one or more emulators are running, you can use the
`list` subcommand to see the name and status of all running emulators, and the
`show` subcommand to get a printout of the configuration for a specific
emulator. When you're done with an emulator, use the `stop` subcommand to
cleanly terminate that emulator.

For more information on the Fuchsia emulator, see the Getting Started page at
https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/set_up_femu."
