//! Provides an abstract interface for connecting and interacting with emulator consoles.
//! Currently, this is built around the consoles we have available in Qemu-based emulators,
//! as exposed by Linux sockets, but should be easily extendable to similar console types.
//!
//! Currently the interface is pretty sparse, as we're only beginning to explore the
//! capabilities of these consoles. The emulator "console" command can create a new socket,
//! and attach threads to read and write on that socket. This enables manual experimentation
//! on an emulator launched with `ffx emu`. As we shift other functionality to the consoles
//! (e.g. status queries, shutdown commands, etc.), this is where that functionality will be
//! exposed.
