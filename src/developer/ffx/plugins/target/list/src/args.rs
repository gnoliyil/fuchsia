    note = "List all targets that the daemon currently has in memory. This includes
manually added targets. The daemon also proactively discovers targets as
they come online. Use `ffx target list` to always get the latest list
of targets.

The default target is marked with a '*' next to the node name. The table
has the following columns:

    NAME = The name of the target.
    SERIAL = The serial number of the target.
    TYPE = The product type of the target.
    STATE = The high-level state of the target.
    ADDRS/IP = The discovered and known addresses of the target.
    RCS = Indicates if the Remote Control Service is running on the target.

The NAME column shows the target's advertised name. When the target is
in early boot state such as fastboot, the NAME column may be `<unknown>` with
a STATE being `fastboot` and a SERIAL attribute.

By default, the `list` command outputs in a tabular format. To override
the format, pass `--format` and can take the following options: 'simple'
, 'tabular|table|tab', 'addresses|addrs|addr', 'name-only', 'json|JSON' or
in short form 's', 't', 'a', 'n', 'j'.

By default, Zedboot discovery is disabled.  To enable discovery of Zedboot
targets run:

    $ ffx config set discovery.zedboot.enabled true
