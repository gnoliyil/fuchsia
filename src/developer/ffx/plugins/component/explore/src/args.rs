    note = "When --layout=nested (the default), the environment contains the following
directories of the explored instance:
* /ns       The namespace of the instance
* /exposed  The capabilities exposed by the instance
* /out      The outgoing directory of the instance, if it is running
* /runtime  The runtime directory of the instance, if it is running

The environment also contains the following directories, irrespective of the explored instance:
* /.dash    User-added and built-in dash tools
* /svc      Protocols required by the dash shell

When --layout=namespace, the contents of the /ns dir above are placed at / with two protocols
(fuchsia.process.Launcher and fuchsia.process.Resolver) overlayed into /svc. In this mode, the
exposed, out, and runtime directories will not be accessible.

With --tools, tools in the specified package will be loaded into /.dash/tools/<pkg>/<binary>
The path is set so that they can be run by name. The path preference is in the command line order
of the --tools arguments, with any built-in tools taking lowest priority.

--tools URLs may be package or binary URLs. If a package URL is given, tool executables are expected
to be in a bin/ dir within the package. If a specific tool URL is given, append the tool path
to the package URL. For example: --tools fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/my_package#bin/my_tool. Note that
naming collisions can occur if multiple packages share a package or binary name. An error,
`NonUniqueBinaryName`, is returned if a binary name collision occurs.
