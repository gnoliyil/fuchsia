$ ffx component route /core/font_provider

This will perform routing on all the capabilities used or exposed by `font_provider`, and display
information for each route including its status (success or failure) and the identity of the source
component providing the capability.

$ ffx component route fonts.cm

This does the same thing, except with a fuzzy match (on the URL).

$ ffx component route /core/font_provider fuchsia.pkg.FontResolver

This will perform routing on capabilities used or exposed by `font_provider` that match
`fuchsia.pkg.FontResolver`.

$ ffx component route /core/font_provider use:fuchsia.pkg.FontResolver,expose:fuchsia.fonts.Provider

This will perform routing from `font_provider` on used capability `fuchsia.pkg.FontResolver` and
exposed capability `fuchsia.fonts.Provider`.

$ ffx component route /core/font_provider fuchsia.pkg

Fuzzy matching by capability is also supported. This will perform routing from `font_provider` on
any used or exposed capability matching *fuchsia.pkg*.
