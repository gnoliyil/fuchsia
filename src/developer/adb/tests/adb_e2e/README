# adb end to end tests

This folder contains host side python based end to end tests for adb support.

## Running the test manually

Include adb support in the build by following instructions in adb
[README](/src/developer/adb/README.md). Additionally, add these args to `fx set` to include adb end
to end tests in the build

```
--with '//src/developer/adb/tests/adb_e2e:manual_tests'
```

Once the device boots, you can run the host tests with the following command -

```
fx test adb_e2e_tests
```

The `adb_e2e_tests` target is not run on any CI/CQ and is meant for manual testing.

## Including adb e2e tests into CI/CQ

Use the `adb_e2e` template to defined in
[/src/developer/adb/tests/adb_e2e/adb_e2e.gni](/src/developer/adb/tests/adb_e2e/adb_e2e.gni) to
create a new test target and define environment parameters specific to CI/CQ builders to include the
test. You can follow the `adb_e2e_tests` target as an example.
