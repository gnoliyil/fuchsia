Description:
Copies function declarations from vulkan.h (from Fuchsia mirror of the Khronos
Vulkan-Headers repo), and adds stub implementations.  The purpose is to provide
a null implementation of Vulkan which will fail any attempt to create a
VkInstances or VkDevice; this is useful for running host tests on test servers
that have not been configured with Vulkan.
