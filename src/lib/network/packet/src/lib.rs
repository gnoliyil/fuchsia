//! Parsing and serialization of (network) packets.
//!
//! `packet` is a library to help with the parsing and serialization of nested
//! packets. Network packets are the most common use case, but it supports any
//! packet structure with headers, footers, and nesting.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! The core components of `packet` are the various buffer traits (`XxxBuffer`
//! and `XxxBufferMut`). A buffer is a byte buffer with a prefix, a body, and a
//! suffix. The size of the buffer is referred to as its "capacity", and the
//! size of the body is referred to as its "length". Depending on which traits
//! are implemented, the body of the buffer may be able to shrink or grow as
//! allowed by the capacity as packets are parsed or serialized.
//!
//! ## Parsing
//!
//! When parsing packets, the body of the buffer stores the next packet to be
//! parsed. When a packet is parsed from the buffer, any headers, footers, and
//! padding are "consumed" from the buffer. Thus, after a packet has been
//! parsed, the body of the buffer is equal to the body of the packet, and the
//! next call to `parse` will pick up where the previous call left off, parsing
//! the next encapsulated packet.
//!
//! Packet objects - the Rust objects which are the result of a successful
//! parsing operation - are advised to simply keep references into the buffer
//! for the header, footer, and body. This avoids any unnecessary copying.
//!
//! For example, consider the following packet structure, in which a TCP segment
//! is encapsulated in an IPv4 packet, which is encapsulated in an Ethernet
//! frame. In this example, we omit the Ethernet Frame Check Sequence (FCS)
//! footer. If there were any footers, they would be treated the same as
//! headers, except that they would be consumed from the end and working towards
//! the beginning, as opposed to headers, which are consumed from the beginning
//! and working towards the end.
//!
//! Also note that, in order to satisfy Ethernet's minimum body size
//! requirement, padding is added after the IPv4 packet. The IPv4 packet and
//! padding together are considered the body of the Ethernet frame. If we were
//! to include the Ethernet FCS footer in this example, it would go after the
//! padding.
//!

//! |-------------------------------------|++++++++++++++++++++|-----| TCP segment
//! |-----------------|++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|-----| IPv4 packet
//! |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| Ethernet frame
//!
//! |-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----|
//!   Ethernet header      IPv4 header         TCP segment      Padding
//! ```
//!
//! At first, the buffer's body would be equal to the bytes of the Ethernet
//! frame (although depending on how the buffer was initialized, it might have
//! extra capacity in addition to the body):
//!
//! ```text
//! |-------------------------------------|++++++++++++++++++++|-----| TCP segment
//! |-----------------|++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|-----| IPv4 packet
//! |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| Ethernet frame
//!
//! |-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----|
//!   Ethernet header      IPv4 header         TCP segment      Padding
//!
//! |----------------------------------------------------------------|
//!                             Buffer Body
//! ```
//!
//! First, the Ethernet frame is parsed. This results in a hypothetical
//! `EthernetFrame` object (this library does not provide any concrete parsing
//! implementations) with references into the buffer, and updates the body of
//! the buffer to be equal to the body of the Ethernet frame:
//!
//! ```text
//! |-------------------------------------|++++++++++++++++++++|-----| TCP segment
//! |-----------------|++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|-----| IPv4 packet
//! |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| Ethernet frame
//!
//! |-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
//!   Ethernet header                  Ethernet body
//!          |                                 |
//!          +--------------------------+      |
//!                                     |      |
//!                   EthernetFrame { header, body }
//!
//! |-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
//!    buffer prefix                   buffer body
//! ```
//!
//! The `EthernetFrame` object mutably borrows the buffer. So long as it exists,
//! the buffer cannot be used directly (although the `EthernetFrame` object may
//! be used to access or modify the contents of the buffer). In order to parse
//! the body of the Ethernet frame, we have to drop the `EthernetFrame` object
//! so that we can call methods on the buffer again. \[1\]
//!
//! After dropping the `EthernetFrame` object, the IPv4 packet is parsed. Recall
//! that the Ethernet body contains both the IPv4 packet and some padding. Since
//! IPv4 packets encode their own length, the IPv4 packet parser is able to
//! detect that some of the bytes it's operating on are padding bytes. It is the
//! parser's responsibility to consume and discard these bytes so that they are
//! not erroneously treated as part of the IPv4 packet's body in subsequent
//! parsings.
//!
//! This parsing results in a hypothetical `Ipv4Packet` object with references
//! into the buffer, and updates the body of the buffer to be equal to the body
//! of the IPv4 packet:
//!
//! ```text
//! |-------------------------------------|++++++++++++++++++++|-----| TCP segment
//! |-----------------|++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|-----| IPv4 packet
//! |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| Ethernet frame
//!
//! |-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----|
//!                        IPv4 header          IPv4 body
//!                             |                   |
//!                             +-----------+       |
//!                                         |       |
//!                          Ipv4Packet { header, body }
//!
//! |-------------------------------------|--------------------|-----|
//!              buffer prefix                 buffer body       buffer suffix
//! ```
//!
//! We can continue this process as long as we like, repeatedly parsing
//! subsequent packet bodies until there are no more packets to parse.
//!
//! \[1\] It is also possible to treat the `EthernetFrame`'s `body` field as a
//! buffer and parse from it directly. However, this has the disadvantage that
//! if parsing is spread across multiple functions, the functions which parse
//! the inner packets only see part of the buffer, and so if they wish to later
//! re-use the buffer for serializing new packets (see the "Serialization"
//! section of this documentation), they are limited to doing so in a smaller
//! buffer, making it more likely that a new buffer will need to be allocated.
//!
//! ## Serialization
//!
//! In this section, we will illustrate serialization using the same packet
//! structure that was used to illustrate parsing - a TCP segment in an IPv4
//! packet in an Ethernet frame.
//!
//! Serialization comprises two tasks:
//! - First, given a buffer with sufficient capacity, and part of the packet
//!   already serialized, serialize the next layer of the packet. For example,
//!   given a buffer with a TCP segment already serialized in it, serialize the
//!   IPv4 header, resulting in an IPv4 packet containing a TCP segment.
//! - Second, given a description of a nested sequence of packets, figure out
//!   the constraints that a buffer must satisfy in order to be able to fit the
//!   entire sequence, and allocate a buffer which satisfies those constraints.
//!   This buffer is then used to serialize one layer at a time, as described in
//!   the previous bullet.
//!
//! ### Serializing into a buffer
//!
//! The [`PacketBuilder`] trait is implemented by types which are capable of
//! serializing a new layer of a packet into an existing buffer. For example, we
//! might define an `Ipv4PacketBuilder` type, which describes the source IP
//! address, destination IP address, and any other metadata required to generate
//! the header of an IPv4 packet. Importantly, a `PacketBuilder` does *not*
//! define any encapsulated packets. In order to construct a TCP segment in an
//! IPv4 packet, we would need a separate `TcpSegmentBuilder` to describe the
//! TCP segment.
//!
//! A `PacketBuilder` exposes the number of bytes it requires for headers,
//! footers, and minimum and maximum body lengths via the `constraints` method.
//! It serializes via the `serialize` method.
//!
//! In order to serialize a `PacketBuilder`, a [`SerializeTarget`] must first be
//! constructed. A `SerializeTarget` is a view into a buffer used for
//! serialization, and it is initialized with the proper number of bytes for the
//! header, footer, and body. The number of bytes required for these is
//! discovered through calls to the `PacketBuilder`'s `constraints` method.
//!
//! The `PacketBuilder`'s `serialize` method serializes the headers and footers
//! of the packet into the buffer. It expects that the `SerializeTarget` is
//! initialized with a body equal to the body which will be encapsulated. For
//! example, imagine that we are trying to serialize a TCP segment in an IPv4
//! packet in an Ethernet frame, and that, so far, we have only serialized the
//! TCP segment:
//!
//! ```text
//! |-------------------------------------|++++++++++++++++++++|-----| TCP segment
//! |-----------------|++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|-----| IPv4 packet
//! |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| Ethernet frame
//!
//! |-------------------------------------|--------------------|-----|
//!                                             TCP segment
//!
//! |-------------------------------------|--------------------|-----|
//!              buffer prefix                 buffer body       buffer suffix
//! ```
//!
//! Note that the buffer's body is currently equal to the TCP segment, and the
//! contents of the body are already initialized to the segment's contents.
//!
//! Given an `Ipv4PacketBuilder`, we call the appropriate methods to discover
//! that it requires 20 bytes for its header. Thus, we modify the buffer by
//! extending the body by 20 bytes, and constructing a `SerializeTarget` whose
//! header references the newly-added 20 bytes, and whose body references the
//! old contents of the body, corresponding to the TCP segment.
//!
//! ```text
//! |-------------------------------------|++++++++++++++++++++|-----| TCP segment
//! |-----------------|++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|-----| IPv4 packet
//! |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| Ethernet frame
//!
//! |-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----|
//!                        IPv4 header          IPv4 body
//!                             |                   |
//!                             +-----------+       |
//!                                         |       |
//!                      SerializeTarget { header, body }
//!
//! |-----------------|----------------------------------------|-----|
//!    buffer prefix                 buffer body                 buffer suffix
//! ```
//!
//! We then pass the `SerializeTarget` to a call to the `Ipv4PacketBuilder`'s
//! `serialize` method, and it serializes the IPv4 header in the space provided.
//! When the call to `serialize` returns, the `SerializeTarget` and
//! `Ipv4PacketBuilder` have been discarded, and the buffer's body is now equal
//! to the bytes of the IPv4 packet.
//!
//! ```text
//! |-------------------------------------|++++++++++++++++++++|-----| TCP segment
//! |-----------------|++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|-----| IPv4 packet
//! |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| Ethernet frame
//!
//! |-----------------|----------------------------------------|-----|
//!                                  IPv4 packet
//!
//! |-----------------|----------------------------------------|-----|
//!    buffer prefix                 buffer body                 buffer suffix
//! ```
//!
//! Now, we are ready to repeat the same process with the Ethernet layer of the
//! packet.
//!
//! ### Constructing a buffer for serialization
//!
//! Now that we know how, given a buffer with a subset of a packet serialized
//! into it, we can serialize the next layer of the packet, we need to figure
//! out how to construct such a buffer in the first place.
//!
//! The primary challenge here is that we need to be able to commit to what
//! we're going to serialize before we actually serialize it. For example,
//! consider sending a TCP segment to the network. From the perspective of the
//! TCP module of our code, we don't know how large the buffer needs to be
//! because don't know what packet layers our TCP segment will be encapsulated
//! inside of. If the IP layer decides to route our segment over an Ethernet
//! link, then we'll need to have a buffer large enough for a TCP segment in an
//! IPv4 packet in an Ethernet segment. If, on the other hand, the IP layer
//! decides to route our segment through a GRE tunnel, then we'll need to have a
//! buffer large enough for a TCP segment in an IPv4 packet in a GRE packet in
//! an IP packet in an Ethernet segment.
//!
//! We accomplish this commit-before-serializing via the [`Serializer`] trait. A
//! `Serializer` describes a packet which can be serialized in the future, but
//! which has not yet been serialized. Unlike a `PacketBuilder`, a `Serializer`
//! describes all layers of a packet up to a certain point. For example, a
//! `Serializer` might describe a TCP segment, or it might describe a TCP
//! segment in an IP packet, or it might describe a TCP segment in an IP packet
//! in an Ethernet frame, etc.
//!
//! #### Constructing a `Serializer`
//!
//! `Serializer`s are recursive - a `Serializer` combined with a `PacketBuilder`
//! yields a new `Serializer` which describes encapsulating the original
//! `Serializer` in a new packet layer. For example, a `Serializer` describing a
//! TCP segment combined with an `Ipv4PacketBuilder` yields a `Serializer` which
//! describes a TCP segment in an IPv4 packet. Concretely, given a `Serializer`,
//! `s`, and a `PacketBuilder`, `b`, a new `Serializer` can be constructed by
//! calling `s.encapsulate(b)`. The [`Serializer::encapsulate`] method consumes
//! both the `Serializer` and the `PacketBuilder` by value, and returns a new
//! `Serializer`.
//!
//! Note that, while `Serializer`s are passed around by value, they are only as
//! large in memory as the `PacketBuilder`s they're constructed from, and those
//! should, in most cases, be quite small. If size is a concern, the
//! `PacketBuilder` trait can be implemented for a reference type (e.g.,
//! `&Ipv4PacketBuilder`), and references passed around instead of values.
//!
//! #### Constructing a buffer from a `Serializer`
//!
//! If `Serializer`s are constructed by starting at the innermost packet layer
//! and working outwards, adding packet layers, then in order to turn a
//! `Serializer` into a buffer, they are consumed by starting at the outermost
//! packet layer and working inwards.
//!
//! In order to construct a buffer, the [`Serializer::serialize`] method is
//! provided. It takes a [`NestedPacketBuilder`], which describes one or more
//! encapsulating packet layers. For example, when serializing a TCP segment in
//! an IP packet in an Ethernet frame, the `serialize` call on the IP packet
//! `Serializer` would be given a `NestedPacketBuilder` describing the Ethernet
//! frame. This call would then compute a new `NestedPacketBuilder` describing
//! the combined IP packet and Ethernet frame, and would pass this to a call to
//! `serialize` on the TCP segment `Serializer`.
//!
//! When the innermost call to `serialize` is reached, it is that call's
//! responsibility to produce a buffer which satisfies the constraints passed to
//! it, and to initialize that buffer's body with the contents of its packet.
//! For example, the TCP segment `Serializer` from the preceding example would
//! need to produce a buffer with 38 bytes of prefix for the IP and Ethernet
//! headers, and whose body was initialized to the bytes of the TCP segment.
//!
//! We can now see how `Serializer`s and `PacketBuilder`s compose - the buffer
//! returned from a call to `serialize` satisfies the requirements of the
//! `PacketBuilder::serialize` method - its body is initialized to the packet to
//! be encapsulated, and enough prefix and suffix space exist to serialize this
//! layer's header and footer. For example, the call to `Serializer::serialize`
//! on the TCP segment serializer would return a buffer with 38 bytes of prefix
//! and a body initialized to the bytes of the TCP segment. The call to
//! `Serializer::serialize` on the IP packet would then pass this buffer to a
//! call to `PacketBuilder::serialize` on its `Ipv4PacketBuilder`, resulting in
//! a buffer with 18 bytes of prefix and a body initialized to the bytes of the
//! entire IP packet. This buffer would then be suitable to return from the call
//! to `Serializer::serialize`, allowing the Ethernet layer to continue
//! operating on the buffer, and so on.
//!
//! Note in particular that, throughout this entire process of constructing
//! `Serializer`s and `PacketBuilder`s and then consuming them, a buffer is only
//! allocated once, and each byte of the packet is only serialized once. No
//! temporary buffers or copying between buffers are required.
//!
//! #### Reusing buffers
//!
//! Another important property of the `Serializer` trait is that it can be
//! implemented by buffers. Since buffers contain prefixes, bodies, and
//! suffixes, and since the `Serializer::serialize` method consumes the
//! `Serializer` by value and returns a buffer by value, a buffer is itself a
//! valid `Serializer`. When `serialize` is called, so long as it already
//! satisfies the constraints requested, it can simply return itself by value.
//! If the constraints are not satisfied, it may need to produce a different
//! buffer through some user-defined mechanism (see the [`BufferProvider`] trait
//! for details).
//!
//! This allows existing buffers to be reused in many cases. For example,
//! consider receiving a packet in a buffer, and then responding to that packet
//! with a new packet. The buffer that the original packet was stored in can be
//! used to serialize the new packet, avoiding any unnecessary allocation.

// the padding is required for this reason. It is acceptable because, using the
// body_len field of the encapsulating packet's ParseMetadata, it is possible
// for undo_parse to reconstruct how many padding bytes there were if it needs
// to.
