//! `replace-with` provides the [`replace_with`] function.

use std::{mem, ptr};

/// Uses `f` to replace the referent of `dst` with a new value.
///
/// Reads the current value in `dst`, calls `f` on that value, and overwrites
/// `dst` using the new value returned by `f`. If `f` panics, the process is
/// aborted.
///
/// This is useful for updating a value whose type is not [`Copy`].
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// # use replace_with::replace_with;
/// /// A value that might be stored on the heap (boxed) or on the stack (unboxed).
/// pub enum MaybeBoxed<T> {
///     Boxed(Box<T>),
///     Unboxed(T),
/// }
///
/// impl<T> MaybeBoxed<T> {
///     /// Ensures that `self` is boxed, moving the value to the heap if necessary.
///     pub fn ensure_boxed(&mut self) {
///         replace_with(self, |m| match m {
///             MaybeBoxed::Boxed(b) => MaybeBoxed::Boxed(b),
///             MaybeBoxed::Unboxed(u) => MaybeBoxed::Boxed(Box::new(u)),
///         })
///     }

    let dst = dst as *mut T;

    // SAFETY:
    // - The initial `ptr::read` is sound because `dst` is derived from a `&mut
    //   T`, and so all of `ptr::read`'s safety preconditions are satisfied:
    //   - `dst` is valid for reads
    //   - `dst` is properly aligned
    //   - `dst` points at a properly initialized value of type `T`
    // - After `ptr::read` is called, we've created a copy of `*dst`. Since `T:
    //   !Copy`, it is not guaranteed that operating on both copies would be
    //   sound. Since we allow `f` to operate on `old`, we have to ensure that
    //   no code operates on `*dst`. This could happen in a few circumstances:
    //   - Code in this function could operate on `*dst`, which it doesn't.
    //   - Code in `f` could operate on `*dst`. Since `dst` is a mutable
    //     reference, and it is borrowed for the duration of this function call,
    //     `f` cannot also access `dst` (code that attempted to do that would
    //     fail to compile).
    //   - The caller could operate on `dst` after the function returns. There
    //     are two cases:
    //     - In the success case, `f` returns without panicking. It returns a
    //       new `T`, and we overwrite `*dst` with this new `T` using
    //       `ptr::write`. At this point, it is sound for code to operate on
    //       `*dst`, and so it is sound for this function to return.
    //     - In the failure case, `f` panics. Since, at the point we call `f`,
    //       we have not overwritten `*dst` yet, it would be unsound if the
    //       panic were to unwind the stack, allowing code from the caller to
    //       run. Since we call `f` within a call to `abort_on_panic`, we are
    //       guaranteed that the process would abort, and no future code could
    //       run.
    // - The call to `ptr::write` itself is sound because, thanks to `dst`
    //   being derived from a `&mut T`, all of `ptr::write`'s preconditions are
    //   satisfied:
    //   - `dst` is valid for writes
    //   - `dst` is properly aligned
