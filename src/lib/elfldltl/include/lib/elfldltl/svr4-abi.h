  // on different systems.  On traditional POSIX systems, it's usually an
  // absolute path name.  On Fuchsia, it's just the name that was presented to
  // the loader service protocol, usually just the plain DT_NEEDED string

  // Some dynamic linkers on some systems will apply the load bias to address
  // values in .dynamic entries and update them in place, while others do not;
  // on systems like Fuchsia where `-z rodynamic` is on by default, this points
  // to read-only space that cannot have been modified to apply the load bias.
  // A reasonable heuristic is to check whether an address value in an entry
  // falls within the bounds of the load image based on its PT_LOAD headers and

  // probably unrelocated.
