// This is the API for reading in dumps, both `ET_CORE` files and job archives.
//
// The zxdump::TaskHolder object is a container that holds the data from any
// number of dump files.  It provides access to the data as a Zircon job tree.
// The Job, Process, and Thread objects represent the jobs and processes found
// in dump files.  Each object provides calls analogous to the Zircon get_info,
// get_property, read_memory, and read_state calls, as well as get_child for
// nagivating a task tree.
//
// Dumps are inserted into the container by providing the file descriptor.  The
// type of file will be determined automatically from its contents.  Dump files
// can be ELF core dump (`ET_CORE`) files, or `ar` archive files.  An archive
// file can be a job archive or just a plain archive of other dump files.  Job
// archives can be mere "stub archives", or full hierarchical job archives, or
// flattened job archives.
//
// All the jobs and processes found in the dumps inserted then self-assemble
// into a job tree.  If the same task (same KOID) appears a second time either
// in two dump files or in two members of a job archive, insertion fails but
// may have added some of the tasks from the dump anyway.
//
// If every process and every job but one is a child of another job found in
// the dump so they all form a single job tree, then `root_job` returns the
// root of that tree.  If not, then `root_job` returns a fake "root job" with a
// KOID of 0 and no information or properties available except for the children
// and process lists.  These show all the jobs that don't have parent jobs that
// were dumped, i.e. the roots of job trees; and all the processes that aren't
// part of any dumped job at all.  Hence populating the container with a single
// ELF core dump will yield a fake root job whose sole child is that process.
//
// Methods that can fail use a result type with zxdump::Error.  When the
// `status_` field is ZX_ERR_IO, that means the failure was in a POSIXish
// filesystem access function and `errno` is set to indicate the exact error.
// Otherwise the error codes have mostly the same meaning they would have for
// the real Zircon calls, with some amendments:
//
//  * ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED just means the dump didn't include the requested
//    type of data.  It doesn't indicate whether the kernel didn't support it,
//    or the dump-writer intentionally chose not to dump it, or the dump was
//    just truncated, etc.
//
//  * Process::read_memory fails with ZX_ERR_NOT_FOUND if the dump indicated
//    the memory mapping existed but the dump did not include that memory.
//    ZX_ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE means the memory is absent because the dump was
//    truncated though this memory was intended to be included in the dump.
//    ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY has the kernel's meaning that there was no memory
//    mapped at that address in the process.  ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED means that
//    the dump was inserted with the `read_memory=false` flag.
