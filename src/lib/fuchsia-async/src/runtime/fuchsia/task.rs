///
/// - The input function should not interact with the executor. Attempting to do so
///   can cause runtime errors. This includes spawning, creating new executors,
///   passing futures between the input function and the calling context, and
///   in some cases constructing async-aware types (such as IO-, IPC- and timer objects).
/// - Synchronous functions cannot be cancelled and may keep running after
///   the returned future is dropped. As a result, resources held by the function
///   should be assumed to be held until the returned future completes.
/// - This function assumes panic=abort semantics, so if the input function panics,
///   the process aborts. Behavior for panic=unwind is not defined.
