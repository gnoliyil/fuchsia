// Flow of the FIDL client side test suite:
// - Clients start the [`Runner`] protocol as a discoverable protocol.
// - Test harness uses the runner protocol to check if a test is enabled.
// - Test harness uses the runner protocol to request that the client make a
//   particular method call. The run request includes the client end that the
//   request should be sent on.
// - Client calls the requested method and waits for a response from the harness.
// - Client classifies the response and returns it back to the harness on the
//   runner protocol.
