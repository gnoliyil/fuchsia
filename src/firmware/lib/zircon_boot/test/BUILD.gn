# item service implementation to extract the bootfs files. The library is only
# available in the fuchsia tool chain. Therefore we need to write the test as a
# fuchsia test package to run on device directly.

# Additionally, the library is written in rust. In order to use it for our cpp
# unittest, we write a rust static library in rust/factory_bootfs_util that
# exposes a C wrapper for the interface.
