# Input Pipeline

The Input Pipeline component has been removed. See related topics:

- The [Input Pipeline](./../../lib/input_pipeline/README.md) library is still in tact, and contains the source code for managing input device lifecycle and lower-level input event dispatch.
- The [Scene Manager](./../scene_manager/README.md) component integrates the Input Pipeline library to provide input functionality on products.
