# Root Presenter

The Root Presenter component has been deprecated and removed. Specifically, it has been replaced with:

- [Input Pipeline](./../input-pipeline/README.md) for managing input device lifecycle and lower-level
  input event dispatch, and
- [Scene Manager](./../scene_manager/README.md) for creating the root of the global scene graph and
  connecting root-level Views by clients such as Sys UI.
- [Virtual Keyboard Manager](./../virtual_keyboard_manager/README.md) for providing virtual keyboard
  functionality.
