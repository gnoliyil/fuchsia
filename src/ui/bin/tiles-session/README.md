```
fx set <product>.<board> --with //src/ui/bin/tiles-session
```

### Launch `tiles-session`

```
ffx session launch fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/tiles-session#meta/tiles-session.cm
```

## Current limitations
*TODO(fxbug.dev/88656): update the following as features are added, and delete when fully-featured.*
Only one view is supported. Adding an additional view replaces the existing one.

# Use cases

`tile-session` fills a few roles in the Fuchsia ecosystem:

- educational: explain workings of a simple yet fully-functional session
