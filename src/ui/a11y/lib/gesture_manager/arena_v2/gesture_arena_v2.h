class GestureRecognizerV2;

// The Gesture Arena for accessibility services.
//
// The Gesture Arena manages several recognizers which are trying to interpret a gesture that is
// being performed. It respects the following rules:
//  * Contests begin at the start of an interaction, and continue until every recognizer has either
//    accepted or rejected.
//  * Of the recognizers that accept, a win is awarded to the highest priority recognizer.
//
// All recognizers must eventually accept or reject. Once a recognizer has decided, it may not
// change its mind.
//
// Recognizers continue to receive incoming pointer events until they release
// their |ParticipationToken| or are defeated. After the winning recognizer
// releases its |ParticipationToken|, the next interaction will begin a new
// contest. (Or, if all recognizers reject, then the next interaction will begin
// a new contest.)
//
// The order in which recognizers are added to the arena determines event dispatch order and win
// priority. When routing pointer events to recognizers, they see the event in order they were
// added. During resolution, if multiple recognizers declared "accept", the one that was added
// first is awarded the win.
//
// In this model, it is important to notice that there are two layers of abstraction:
// 1. Raw pointer events, which come from the input system, arrive at the arena and are dispatched
//    to recognizers via an |InteractionTracker|.
// 2. Gestures, which are sequences of pointer events with a semantic meaning, are identified by
//    recognizers.
//
// With that in mind, each recognizer defines the semantic meaning for the sequence of pointer
// events that it is receiving. In another words, it is expected that a recognizer could identify a
// single tap, another a double tap, and so on.
//
// "Accepting" indicates that a recognizer identified a gesture. However, that recognizer may not
// necessarily be awarded a win, if a higher priority recognizer also accepts. Recognizers are free
// to handle their events optimistically, but if they do then they must undo/reset any changes they
// effect if they are eventually defeated. For example, a single-tap recognizer may accept, but if
// a higher-priority double-tap recognzier also accepts, the latter will win.
//
// Recognizers should not destroy the arena.
//
// If any recognizer accepts, the input system is immediately notified that the interactions
// were consumed (as would be any new interactions until the end of the gesture).
// If all recognizers reject, the input system is notified that the interactions were rejected.
//
// Implementation notes: this arena is heavily influenced by Fluttter's gesture arena:
// https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/advanced/gestures For those familiar how Flutter version
// works, here are the important main differences:
// - The arena here is not per finger (a.k.a. per pointer ID), which means that recognizers may
//   receive events from multiple interactions (i.e. fingers) concurrently.
// - There are not default wins or multiple levels of acceptance. Recognizers must be certain when
//   they decide to accept.
