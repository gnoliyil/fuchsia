class GestureRecognizer;

// The Gesture Arena for accessibility services.
//
// The Gesture Arena manages several recognizers which are trying to interpret a gesture that is
// being performed. It respects the following rules:
//  * Contests begin when a touch pointer is added and continue until every member has either
//    claimed a win or declared defeat.
//  * Of the members that claim a win, the win is awarded to the highest priority member.
//
// All members must eventually claim a win or declare defeat. Once a member has claimed a win or
// declared defeat, it may not change its declaration.
//
// Recognizers continue to receive incoming pointer events until they release their |ContestMember|
// or are defeated. After the winning recognizer releases its |ContestMember|, the next interaction
// will begin a new contest.
//
// The order in which recognizers are added to the arena determines event dispatch order and win
// priority. When routing pointer events to recognizers, they see the event in order they were
// added. Then they have the chance to claim a win before the next recognizer in the list has the
// chance to act. Then, during resolution, if multiple recognizers claim a win, the one that was
// added first is awarded the win.
//
// In this model, it is important to notice that there are two layers of abstraction:
// 1. Raw pointer events, which come from the input system, arrive at the arena and are dispatched
//    to recognizers via a PointerStreamTracker.
// 2. Gestures, which are sequences of pointer events with a semantic meaning, are identified by
//    recognizers.
//
// With that in mind, each recognizer defines the semantic meaning for the sequence of pointer
// events that it is receiving. In another words, it is expected that a recognizer could identify a
// single tap, another a double tap, and so on.
//
// Claiming a win indicates that a recognizer identified a gesture. However, the win will not
// necessarily be awarded to that recognizer. Recognizers are free to handle their events
// optimistically, but if they do then they must undo/reset any changes they effect if they are
// eventually defeated.
//
// Recognizers should not destroy the arena.
//
// If any member claims a win, the input system is immediately notified that the pointer event
// streams were consumed (as would be any new pointer event streams until the end of the gesture).
// If no member claims a win, the input system is notified that the pointer event streams were
// rejected.
//
// Implementation notes: this arena is heavily influenced by Fluttter's gesture arena:
// https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/advanced/gestures For those familiar how Flutter version
// works, here are the important main differences:
// - The arena here is not per finger (a.k.a. per pointer ID), which means that
//   recognizers receive the whole interaction with the screen.
// - There are not default wins or mutiple levels of acceptance. Recognizers must be certain when
//   they claim a win.
