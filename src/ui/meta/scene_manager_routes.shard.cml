// This shard includes the portion of the scene manager layer that is
// common across all production ui realms that include scene manager, but
// differs from test ui realms.
//
// Production ui realms should include this shard directly.
//
// This shard should include:
//
// (1) Scene manager's child declaration. Note that other shards assume the name
//     "scene_manager".
// (2) Capability routes to scene manager that are the same for all production ui
//     realms in which scene manager is present, but differ in test realms.
//
// This shard should **NOT** include:
//
// (1) Routes that are common to all production and test ui realms; these
//     routes belong in scene_manager_base_routes.shard.cml.
// (2) Routes to scene manager that differ among production ui realms.
// (3) Routes **FROM** scene manager to other components in the ui realm; these
//     routes belong in the target components' routing shards.
