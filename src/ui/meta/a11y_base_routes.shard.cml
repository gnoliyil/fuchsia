// This shard is shared across all production and test UI realms that
// contain a11y.
//
// It contains any capabilities that:
//
// (1) A11y manager exposes from every production or test UI realm in which
//     it's present.
// (2) A11y manager always consumes from the same source in every production
//     or test UI realm in which it's present.
//
// This shard should **NOT** include:
//
// (1) Routes that have different sources in different ui realms.
// (2) A11y manager's child definition, as we may use a differnt url for
//     a11y manager in test vs. production ui realms.
// (3) Capabilities that other components consume from a11y manager. Those
//     routes belong in those components' routing shards.
