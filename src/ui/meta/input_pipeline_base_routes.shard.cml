// This shard is shared across all production and test UI realms that
// contain input pipeline.
//
// It contains any capabilities that:
//
// (1) Input pipeline exposes from every production or test UI realm in
//     which it's present.
// (2) Input pipeline always consumes from the same source in every
//     production or test UI realm in which it's present.
//
// This shard should **NOT** include:
//
// (1) Routes that have different sources in different ui realms.
// (2) Input pipeline's child definition, as we may use a differnt url
//     in test vs. production ui realms.
// (3) Capabilities that other components consume from input pipeline.
//     Those routes belong in those components' routing shards.
