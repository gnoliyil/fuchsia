// This shard includes the portion of the scenic layer that is common
// across all production ui realms that include scenic, but differs from
// test ui realms.
//
// Production ui realms should include this shard directly.
//
// This shard should include:
//
// (1) Scenic's child declaration. Note that other shards assume the name
//     "scenic".
// (2) Capability routes to scenic that are the same for all production ui
//     realms in which scenic is present, but differ in test realms.
//
// This shard should **NOT** include:
//
// (1) Routes that are common to all production and test ui realms; these
//     routes belong in scenic_base_routes.shard.cml.
// (2) Routes to scenic that differ among production ui realms.
// (3) Routes **FROM** scenic to other components in the ui realm; these
//     routes belong in the target components' routing shards.
