// ReleaseFenceManager is a helper which encapsulates the logic for signaling release fences, and
// for invoking frame-presented callbacks according to the contract with FrameScheduler.
//
// === Design Requirements for signaling client release fences ===
//
// Client release fences are signaled as soon as it is safe to do so without risking visual
// artifacts.  The time that it becomes safe depends on whether a frame is GPU-composited or
// direct-scanout.
//
// GPU-composition case: fences can be signaled as soon as Vulkan is finished rendering the frame.
// Direct-scanout case: client images are directly read by the display controller, and so the fences
// cannot be signaled until the *next* frame is displayed on-screen.
//
// ReleaseFenceManager handles these cases separately, in order to minimize the latency before
// clients can reuse their images.
//
// === Design Requirements for invoking FramePresentedCallback ===
//
// The contract with FrameScheduler requires that these callbacks are invoked in the order that they
// are received.  As a result, callback invocation may be delayed even though all of the information
// required by the callback is known (i.e. render-finished time and frame-presented time), when an
// earlier callback is not yet ready to invoke.
//
// For example, this can happen when a GPU-composited frame misses a vsync because rendering is
// still not finished, even though the subsequent direct-scanout frame is already on the screen.
// Ordinarily, the callback for the second frame could be invoked, but in this scenario it cannot
// because it must wait for the first callback to be invoked, which must wait until Vulkan signals
// the render-finished fence.
//
// === Usage ===
//
// ReleaseFenceManager is very simple to use.  Each frame, the caller (typically DisplayCompositor)
// calls either OnGpuCompositedFrame() or OnDirectScanoutFrame().  The caller has two other
// responsibilities:
//
// 1) for GPU-composited frames, to signal the |render_finished_event| (typically done via a Vulkan
//    semaphore).
//
// 2) to call OnVsync() when a frame is presented on the display
//
// === Thread Safety ===
//
// ReleaseFenceManager is not thread-safe; methods should only be called from the "main thread",
// i.e. the same thread as used by the |dispatcher| passed to the constructor.  Due to the use
// of this dispatcher, it is not safe to use from multiple threads even if externally
// synchronized, e.g. via a mutex.
