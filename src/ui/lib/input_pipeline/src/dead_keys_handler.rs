//! Implements dead key handling.
//!
//! Dead key is a character composition approach where an accented character,
//! typically from a Western European alphabet, is composed by actuating two
//! keys on the keyboard:
//!
//! 1. A "dead key" which determines which diacritic is to be placed on the
//!    character, and which produces no immediate output; and
//! 2. The character onto which the diacritic is to be placed.
//!
//! The resulting two successive key actuations produce an effect of single
//! accented character being emitted.
//!
//! The dead key handler relies on keymap already having been applied, and the
//! use of key meanings.
//!
//! This means that the dead key handler must be added to the input pipeline
//! after the keymap handler in the input pipeline.
//!
//! The dead key handler can delay or modify the key meanings, but it never delays nor
//! modifies key events.  This ensures that clients which require key events see the
//! key events as they come in.  The key meanings may be delayed because of the delayed
//! effect of composition.
//!
//! The state machine of the dead key handler is watching for dead key and "live" key
//! combinations, and handles all their possible interleaving. The event sequences
//! vary from the "obvious" ones such as "dead key press and release followed
//! by a live key press and release", to not so obvious ones such as: "dead key
//! press and hold, shift press, live key press and hold followed by another
//! live key press, followed by arbitrary sequence of key releases".
//!
//! See the documentation for [Handler] for some more detail.

/// State contains the current observed state of the dead key state machine.

/// the "live" key that we will attempt to add a diacritic to.  When such a live
/// key is actuated, we will emit a key meaning equivalent to producing an
/// accented character.
///
/// A complication here is that composition can unfold in any number of ways.
/// The user could press and release the dead key, then press and release
/// the live key.  The user could, also, press and hold the dead key, then
/// press any number of live or dead keys in an arbitrary order.
///
/// Another complication is that the user could press the dead key twice, which
/// should also be handled correctly. In this case, "correct" handling implies
/// emitting the dead key as an accented character.  Similarly, two different
/// dead keys pressed in succession are handled by (1) emitting the first as
/// an accented character, and restarting composition with the second. It is
/// worth noting that the key press and key release events could be arbitrarily
/// interleaved for the two dead keys, and that should be handled correctly too.
///
/// A third complication is that, while all the composition is taking place,
/// the pipeline must emit the `KeyEvent`s consistent with the key event protocol,
/// but keep key meanings suppressed until the time that the key meanings have
/// been resolved by the combination.
///
/// The elements of state are as follows:
///
///   * Did we see a dead key press event? (bit `a`)
///   * Did we see a dead key release event? (bit `b`)
///   * Did we see a live key press event? (bit `c`)
///   * Did we see a live key release event? (bit `d`)
///
/// Almost any variation of the above elements is possible and allowed.  Even
/// the states that ostensibly shouldn't be possible (e.g. observed a release
/// event before a press) should be accounted for in order to implement
/// self-correcting behavior if needed.  The [State] enum below encodes each
/// state as a name `Sdcba`, where each of `a..d` are booleans, encoded
/// as characters `0` and `1` as conventional. So for example, `S0101`
/// is a state where we observed a dead key press event, and a live key press
/// event.  I made an experiment where I tried to use more illustrative state
/// names, but the number of variations didn't make the resulting names any more
/// meaningful compared to the current state name encoding scheme. So compact
