//! The `exec` library provides common tools and interfaces that allow users to run and manage
//! software on Fuchsia at various levels of abstraction, from Zircon processes to components.
//!
//! # Lifecycle Traits
//!
//! The `Start` and `Stop` traits represent the fundamental `exec` state machine. Types that
//! implement `Start` can be started, moving them into a "started" state. This returns a
//! typestate that implements the `Stop` trait, used to transition into a "stopped" state.
//!
//! This structure has the following properties:
//!
//! * Any type that can be started, can be stopped.
//! * Types may be stopped implicitly (for example, due to a crash)
//! * A type that implements `Stop`, but not `Start`, cannot be restarted.
//!
//! # Built-in Implementations
//!
//! This library contains a few built-in implementations of the lifecycle traits:
//!
//! * `Elf`: Runs ELF binaries, possibly from a package.
//! * `BuiltProcess`: Runs a Zircon process given a `process_builder::BuiltProcess`.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A type that can be started once:
//!
//! ```
//! use exec::*;
//! use async_trait::async_trait;
//!
//! struct SingleRun {}
//!
//! #[async_trait]
//! impl Start for SingleRun {
//!     type Error = ();
//!     type Stop = Execution;
//!
//!     async fn start(self) -> Result<Self::Stop, Self::Error> {
//!         Ok(Execution {})
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! struct Execution {}
//!
//! #[async_trait]
//! impl Stop for Execution {
//!     type Error = ();
//!
//!     async fn stop(&mut self) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A type that can be restarted, implementing both `Start` and `Stop`:
//!
//! ```
//! use exec::*;
//! use async_trait::async_trait;
//!
//! struct Restartable {}
//!
//! #[async_trait]
//! impl Start for Restartable {
//!     type Error = ();
//!     type Stop = Self;
//!
//!     async fn start(self) -> Result<Self::Stop, Self::Error> {
//!         Ok(self)
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! #[async_trait]
//! impl Stop for Restartable {
//!     type Error = ();
//!
//!     async fn stop(&mut self) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
