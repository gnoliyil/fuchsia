# Component bedrock

Component bedrock introduces powerful low-level APIs for running programs and
routing capabilities on Fuchsia. Bedrock APIs are the primitives used to define
the Fuchsia component model.

Note: this is a prototype that contains experimental, unratified, but certainly
exciting and possibly revolutionary ideas. Don't depend on it in production.
