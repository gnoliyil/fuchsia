# Defines a new core realm.
#
# The core realm on Fuchsia is a packaged non-executable component that holds
# most of the interesting packaged CFv2 components. This realm is configurable
# on a per-product basis to allow product owners to control which features and
# functionality the component instance tree is capable of on their product.
#
# For typical product definitions, the arguments to this template are set
# through GN arguments, declared in //build/product.gni.
#
# Parameters
#
#   deps
#   testonly
#   visibility
