# POLICIES FOR DOCS REVIEWS
# =========================
#
# - For smaller, technical-focused changes to keep the documentation in sync with the code,
#   get a normal technical review and CC a member of the docs team (see below). You do not have
#   to wait for docs team approval before checking in, but please follow-up with any updates should
#   they have comments.
#
# - For larger changes, significant exposition, introductions, guides, or any changes to the
#   organization of the documentation, add a docs team member (see below) as a normal reviewer
#   and wait for their approval before checking in.
#
# - When in doubt, involve the docs team more! If you notice any reviews that should have docs team
#   involvement, please add an appropriate reviewer. Our ability to have a lightweight docs review
#   process depends on everybody following the rules.
