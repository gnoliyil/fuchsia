## fi-0137: Cannot use union type with deprecated C bindings {:#fi-0137}

Methods used by the [deprecated][0137-deprecated] C bindings cannot contain out
of line data, so using `union` types therein is disallowed:

[0137-deprecated]: /docs/development/languages/fidl/guides/c-family-comparison.md#deprecated_c_bindings.md

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0137.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

See [fi-0138](#fi-0138) for more details on why FIDL has special restrictions on
types and protocols used by the C bindings.
