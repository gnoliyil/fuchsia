# Compatibility Tests for Fuchsia

The Compatibility Tests for Fuchsia (CTF) is a suite of tests designed
to detect compatibility changes between two different versions of the
Fuchsia platform surface.  To learn how it works, and to get started on adding
CTF tests for your area, please see the links below.
