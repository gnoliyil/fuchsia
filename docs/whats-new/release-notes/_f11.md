**Date:** June 22, 2023

**Version:** F11

The following changes have been implemented:

### Component Framework

**Issue:** Migrate components to v2.  
**Impact:** Most components run as v2 in F10 except comms apps, `cast_runner`,
and `web_instance`.

***

### Connectivity

The following updates have been made for connectivity:

#### Netstack

* Added support for MLDv2 and IGMPv3 to support Thread 1.3. Source-specific
  multicast is not supported.

#### Thread

* Logging crate change: replaced with `trace`.
* Added a Multicast routing feature.
* OpenThread fix CP per request from the Nest team.

#### WLAN

**Issue:** Device disconnecting from wireless access point during TDLS
(Tunneled Direct Link Setup) teardown.  
**Impact:** Firmware change on Astro, Sherlock, and Nelson devices.

***

**Issue:** Unbalanced workloads in the network interface and WLAN drivers.  
**Impact:** Improve network performance.

***

### Developer

The following updates have been made for developer workflows:

### Diagnostics

* Archivist memory usage was improved: ~35-45% less usage thanks to string
  interning, dynamically allocated buffers for  logs, no more usage of regular
  expressions for filtering Inspect, among other changes.
* Improved Sampler memory usage by removing of intermediate deserialization, it
  now uses ~5MB less.
* The Rust Inspect library automatically deduplicates and interns strings which
  improves memory usage. Some `InspectHeap` VMOs are up to 48% smaller.
* The benchmarks for snapshotting and filtering Inspect hierarchies show that
  the process is now 95% faster due to  improvements in the algorithm.
* Fix bug which caused Archivist to crash when parsing logs containing invalid
  UTF8. Invalid UTF8 is now replaced with �.
* `ffx log`: `--no-symbols` was renamed to `--raw`. `--moniker` was introduced
  to filter logs by moniker.
* Dynamic log registration got improvements and bug fixes: Archivist wasn’t
  setting dynamic log severity when starting a  component correctly. Components
  now wait for the initial interest.
* Sampler configurations requesting driver manager data were merged into one
  for performance.
* Rust Inspect initialization was improved with a Builder for Inspectors.
* Archivist is now a package in `bootfs`.
* Detect and persistence moved under `/core/diagnostics/*`.

### Graphics and Media

* Magma libraries are now part of the SDK.
* Detailed video codec descriptions to enable more hardware-accelerated video in
  Chromium.
* Improve camera performance when memory pressure is high.

***

**Issue:** If the connection to the Mali driver is being destroyed while a
buffer in that connection is being paged in, that can cause a deadlock on the
device thread.  
**Impact:** Resolve a deadlock in the Mali driver.

***

**Issue:** Unsupported touch screen for Khada TS050.  
**Impact:** Added support for Khadas' TS050 touch screen.

***

**Issue:** Unsupported panel for Microtech MTF050HDI-03.
**Impact:** Added support for Microtech MTF050HDI-03 panel.

***

**Issue:** The `LCD_RESET` function on VIM3 was being used to indicate the HDMI
device's availability. However, on VIM3 `LCD_RESET` is not a GPIO pin, unlike
Astro or Sherlock.  
**Impact:** Fix HDMI hotplug on VIM3.

***

**Issue:** HWASan was detecting use-after-frees in various `msd-vsi-vip` tests.  
**Impact:** Stability fixes for VSI ML driver.

***

### HCI (Input, A11y, i18n, and View System)

UI stack transitioned to Scene Manager and off of Root Presenter.

### Kernel

**Issue:** HWASan was detecting use-after-frees in various `msd-vsi-vip` tests.  
**Impact:** Emit process record for kernel.

***

**Issue:** Unsupported boot tests in UEFI environment for QEMU and AEMU.  
**Impact:** Enable UEFI testing on emulators.

***

**Issue:** Not all references to `zx` have been updated to `zx`.  
**Impact:** Migrate `zxc` references to `zx`.

***

**Issue:** Too much padding in `thread.h`.  
**Impact:** Reduce padding in `thread.h`.

***

**Issue:** Unsupported non-default `val_type` parameters to `fxt::Argument` in
deduced contexts.  
**Impact:** Update serializer templates and dependents in `ktrace`.

***

**Issue:** Not using standard attributes for C++17.  
**Impact:** Undef `__UNUSED` in C++; use `maybe_unused`.

***

**Issue:** Extra processing cost of disabling pre-emption to ensure there is no
gap between mutex acquisition and setting the timeslice extension.  
**Impact:** Improved kernel mutex performance when using timeslice extension.

***

### Platform drivers

**Issue:** Hitting assertions on `focaltouch` startup.  
**Impact:** Fix `focaltouch` assertion. Each `HidInstance` manages its own
bindings.

***

### Software delivery

Landed a fix that allows an Omaha server to tell a device to reboot immediately
after downloading an OTA update.

### Storage

Ported `fshost` from C++ to Rust.
