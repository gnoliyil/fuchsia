# Component manifest (`.cml`) reference

A `.cml` file contains a single json5 object literal with the keys below.

Where string values are expected, a list of valid values is generally documented.
The following string value types are reused and must follow specific rules.

## String types

### Names {#names}

Both capabilities and a component's children are named. A name string must consist of one or
more of the following characters: `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, `.`, `-`.

### References {#references}

A reference string takes the form of `#<name>`, where `<name>` refers to the name of a child:

- A [static child instance][doc-static-children] whose name is
    `<name>`, or
- A [collection][doc-collections] whose name is `<name>`.

## Top-level keys

### `include` {#include}

_array of `string` (optional)_

The optional `include` property describes zero or more other component manifest
files to be merged into this component manifest. For example:

```json5
include: [ "syslog/client.shard.cml" ]
```

In the example given above, the component manifest is including contents from a
manifest shard provided by the `syslog` library, thus ensuring that the
component functions correctly at runtime if it attempts to write to `syslog`. By
convention such files are called "manifest shards" and end with `.shard.cml`.

Include paths prepended with `//` are relative to the source root of the Fuchsia
checkout. However, include paths not prepended with `//`, as in the example
above, are resolved from Fuchsia SDK libraries (`//sdk/lib`) that export
component manifest shards.

For reference, inside the Fuchsia checkout these two include paths are
equivalent:

* `syslog/client.shard.cml`
* `//sdk/lib/syslog/client.shard.cml`

You can review the outcome of merging any and all includes into a component
manifest file by invoking the following command:

Note: The `fx` command below is for developers working in a Fuchsia source
checkout environment.

```sh
fx cmc include {{ "<var>" }}cmx_file{{ "</var>" }} --includeroot $FUCHSIA_DIR --includepath $FUCHSIA_DIR/sdk/lib
```

Includes are transitive, meaning that shards can have their own includes.

Include paths can have diamond dependencies. For instance this is valid:
A includes B, A includes C, B includes D, C includes D.
In this case A will transitively include B, C, D.

Include paths cannot have cycles. For instance this is invalid:
A includes B, B includes A.
A cycle such as the above will result in a compile-time error.

### `disable` {#disable}

_`object` (optional)_

The `disable` section disables certain features in a particular CML that are
otherwise enforced by cmc.

- `must_offer_protocol`: (_optional array of `string`_) Lists protocols for which the option "--must-offer-protocol" is disabled.
- `must_use_protocol`: (_optional array of `string`_) Lists protocols for which the option "--must-use-protocol" is disabled.

Example:

```json5
disable: {
    must_offer_protocol: [ "fuchsia.logger.LogSink", "fuchsia.component.Binder" ],
    must_use_protocol: [ "fuchsia.logger.LogSink" ],
}
```



### `program` {#program}

_`object` (optional)_

Components that are executable include a `program` section. The `program`
section must set the `runner` property to select a [runner][doc-runners] to run
the component. The format of the rest of the `program` section is determined by
that particular runner.

#### ELF runners {#elf-runners}

If the component uses the ELF runner, `program` must include the following
properties, at a minimum:

- `runner`: must be set to `"elf"`
- `binary`: Package-relative path to the executable binary
- `args` _(optional)_: List of arguments

Example:

```json5
program: {
    runner: "elf",
    binary: "bin/hippo",
    args: [ "Hello", "hippos!" ],
},
```

For a complete list of properties, see: [ELF Runner](/docs/concepts/components/v2/elf_runner.md)

#### Other runners {#other-runners}

If a component uses a custom runner, values inside the `program` stanza other
than `runner` are specific to the runner. The runner receives the arguments as a
dictionary of key and value pairs. Refer to the specific runner being used to
determine what keys it expects to receive, and how it interprets them.

[doc-runners]: /docs/concepts/components/v2/capabilities/runners.md

### `children` {#children}

        information.
- `environment`: (_optional `string`_) If present, the name of the environment to be assigned to the child component instance, one
    of [`environments`](#environments). If omitted, the child will inherit the same environment

```



### `capabilities` {#capabilities}

_array of `object` (optional)_

The `capabilities` section defines capabilities that are provided by this component.
Capabilities that are [offered](#offer) or [exposed](#expose) from `self` must be declared
here.

One and only one of the capability type keys (`protocol`, `directory`, `service`, ...) is required.

[glossary.outgoing directory]: /docs/glossary/README.md#outgoing-directory

    program to source the capability.

    For `protocol` and `service`, defaults to `/svc/${protocol}`, otherwise required.

    For `protocol`, the target of the path MUST be a channel, which tends to speak
    the protocol matching the name of this capability.

    For `service`, `directory`, the target of the path MUST be a directory.

    For `runner`, the target of the path MUST be a channel and MUST speak
    the protocol `fuchsia.component.runner.ComponentRunner`.

    For `resolver`, the target of the path MUST be a channel and MUST speak
    the protocol `fuchsia.component.resolution.Resolver`.

        the component ID index will not be able to use this storage capability.
    - `static_instance_id_or_moniker`: If the component is listed in the
        component ID index, the instance ID is used as the key for a component's
        storage. Otherwise, the component's relative moniker from the storage
        capability is used.


### `use` {#use}

_array of `object` (optional)_

For executable components, declares capabilities that this
component requires in its [namespace][glossary.namespace] at runtime.
Capabilities are routed from the `parent` unless otherwise specified,
and each capability must have a valid route through all components between
this component and the capability's source.

[fidl-environment-decl]: /reference/fidl/fuchsia.component.decl#Environment
[glossary.namespace]: /docs/glossary/README.md#namespace

- `service`: (_optional `string or array of strings`_) When using a service capability, the [name](#name) of a [service capability][doc-service].

        requested capability is derived.
    - `#<child-name>`: A [reference](#references) to a child component
        instance.
- `path`: (_optional `string`_) The path at which to install the capability in the component's namespace. For protocols,
    defaults to `/svc/${protocol}`.  Required for `directory` and `storage`. This property is
    disallowed for declarations with arrays of capability names.
- `rights`: (_optional `string`_) (`directory` only) the maximum [directory rights][doc-directory-rights] to apply to
    the directory in the component's namespace.
- `subdir`: (_optional `string`_) (`directory` only) A subdirectory within the directory capability to provide in the
    component's namespace.

        ordering. Component manager is guaranteed to stop the target before the
        source. This is the default.
    - `weak`: a weak dependency, which is ignored during shutdown. When component manager
        stops the parent realm, the source may stop before the clients. Clients of weak
        dependencies must be able to handle these dependencies becoming unavailable.
    - `weak_for_migration`: this has the same runtime consequences as `weak`,
        but also implies this capability will be made strong after completion of the v2
        component migration.
- `availability`: (_optional `string`_) `availability` _(optional)_: The expectations around this capability's availability. One
    of:
    - `required` (default): a required dependency, the component is unable to perform its
        work without this capability.
    - `optional`: an optional dependency, the component will be able to function without this
        capability (although if the capability is unavailable some functionality may be
        disabled).
    - `transitional`: the source may omit the route completely without even having to route
        from `void`. Used for soft transitions that introduce new capabilities.

Example:

```json5
use: [
    {
        protocol: [
            "fuchsia.ui.scenic.Scenic",
            "fuchsia.accessibility.Manager",
        ]
    },

        [`capability`](#capabilities) declaration.
    - `framework`: The Component Framework runtime.
    - `#<child-name>`: A [reference](#references) to a child component
        instance. This source can only be used when offering protocol,

- `subdir`: (_optional `string`_) (`directory` only) the relative path of a subdirectory within the source directory
    capability to route.
- `filter`: (_optional `object`_) Deprecated and unusable. In the process of being removed.
- `event_stream`: (_optional `string or array of strings`_) (`event_stream` only) the name(s) of the event streams being offered.
- `scope`: (_optional `string or array of strings`_) (`event_stream` only) When defined the event stream will contain events about only the
    components defined in the scope.
- `availability`: (_optional `string`_) `availability` _(optional)_: The expectations around this capability's availability. One
    of:
    - `required` (default): a required dependency, the source must exist and provide it. Use
        this when the target of this offer requires this capability to function properly.
    - `optional`: an optional dependency. Use this when the target of this will function
        properly if it does or does not not receive this capability. If the target consumes
        this capability, the target must do so as `optional`. The source of this capability
        may be `void`, and therefore not provide it.
    - `same_as_target`: the availability expectations of this capability will match the
        target's. If the target requires the capability, then this field is set to `required`.
        If the target has an optional dependency on the capability, then the field is set to
        `optional`.
    - `transitional`: the source may omit the route completely without even having to route
        from `void`. Used for soft transitions that introduce new capabilities.
- `source_availability`: (_optional `string`_) Whether or not the source of this offer must exist. If set to `unknown`, the source of this
    offer will be rewritten to `void` if the source does not exist (i.e. is not defined in this
    manifest). Defaults to `required`.

Example:

```json5
offer: [
    {
        protocol: "fuchsia.logger.LogSink",
        from: "#logger",
        to: [ "#fshost", "#pkg_cache" ],
        dependency: "weak_for_migration",
    },
    {
        protocol: [
            "fuchsia.ui.app.ViewProvider",
            "fuchsia.fonts.Provider",
        ],
        from: "#session",
        to: [ "#ui_shell" ],
        dependency: "strong",
    },
    {
        directory: "blobfs",
        from: "self",
        to: [ "#pkg_cache" ],
    },
    {
        directory: "fshost-config",
        from: "parent",
        to: [ "#fshost" ],
        as: "config",
    },
    {
        storage: "cache",
        from: "parent",
        to: [ "#logger" ],
    },
    {
        runner: "web",
        from: "parent",
        to: [ "#user-shell" ],
    },
    {
        resolver: "full-resolver",
        from: "parent",
        to: [ "#user-shell" ],
    },
    {
        event_stream: "stopped",
        from: "framework",
        to: [ "#logger" ],
    },
],
```



### `facets` {#facets}

_`object` (optional)_

Contains metadata that components may interpret for their own purposes. The component
framework enforces no schema for this section, but third parties may expect their facets to
adhere to a particular schema.

### `config` {#config}

_`object` (optional)_

The configuration schema as defined by a component. Each key represents a single field
in the schema.

Configuration fields are JSON objects and must define a `type` which can be one of the
following strings:
`bool`, `uint8`, `int8`, `uint16`, `int16`, `uint32`, `int32`, `uint64`, `int64`,
`string`, `vector`

Example:

```json5
config: {
    debug_mode: {
        type: "bool"
    },
}
```

Strings must define the `max_size` property as a non-zero integer.

Example:

```json5
config: {
    verbosity: {
        type: "string",
        max_size: 20,
    }
}
```

Vectors must set the `max_count` property as a non-zero integer. Vectors must also set the
`element` property as a JSON object which describes the element being contained in the
vector. Vectors can contain booleans, integers, and strings but cannot contain other
vectors.

Example:

```json5
config: {
    tags: {
        type: "vector",
        max_count: 20,
        element: {
            type: "string",
            max_size: 50,
        }
    }
}
```
