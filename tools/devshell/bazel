### Run experimental Bazel build for Fuchsia platform tree

## usage: fx bazel ...
##
## This is a highly experimental command to run Bazel build commands
## directly from the command-line. Only useful for debugging the platform
## build. Note that currently Bazel is automatically invoked by Ninja
## when `fx build` is invoked.
##
## This runs Bazel in a custom workspace under the Fuchsia build directory,
## use `fx bazel info workspace` to print its path.
##
## This command will fail if you have not run `fx gen` or `fx set` previously.
##
## All arguments are passed to the Bazel binary.
