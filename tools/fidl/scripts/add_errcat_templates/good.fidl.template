// TODO(${dns}): After you've extracted the "bad" test case (see the TODO instructions at
// //tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-${num}... for more info), copy that test case here,
// and make the minimal set of changes necessary to make it "good" (aka, to make it compile with no
// warnings or errors). Please try to keep names and incidental properties of the bad case as
// similar as possible!
