  # This is an allowlist of test targets that are allowed to set `isolated =
  # true` so they run on their own shard in continuous integration
  # infrastructure.
  #
  # It is disproportionately expensive to run a test in isolated mode because it
  # requires starting up a new task and possibly a target device once for every
  # single run of the test. Isolated mode should not be used unless absolutely
  # necessary, and justification must be included when it is used.
