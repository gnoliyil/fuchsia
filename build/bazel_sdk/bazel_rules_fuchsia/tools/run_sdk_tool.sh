# Script that, when symlinked from //tools/<TOOLNAME>, will attempt to
# find TOOLNAME in the //tools/<host_architecture/ directory in a Bazel SDK
# located in the "fuchsia_sdk" Bazel workspace.
#
# If the workspace has not been downloaded yet, for example in a new checkout,
# this script will attempt to bootstrap it first.
#
# How to use this script:
#
#    Assuming that sdk-integration is used in your repo as a git submodule in
#    //third_party/sdk-integration, create a symbolic link from //tools/TOOLNAME
#    to this script. For example, from the root of your repo:
#
#        ln -s ../third_party/sdk-integration/bazel_rules_fuchsia/tools/run_sdk_tool.sh tools/ffx
#
#     then you can execute 'tools/ffx' normally.
