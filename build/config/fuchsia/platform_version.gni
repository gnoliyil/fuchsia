# TODO(https://fxbug.dev/104513) upstream clang support for HEAD
# Emulate a "HEAD" API level since it is not supported directly by clang.
# Fuchsia API levels are unsigned 64-bit integers, but clang stores API levels as 32-bit,
# so we define this as `((uint32_t)-1)`. clang expects API levels to be integer literals.
