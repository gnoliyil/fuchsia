# NOTE: This target is used by "fx set --cargo-toml-gen ..." which
# will do the following:
#
#  1) Ensure that "fx gen" (and "fx build") will pass `--ide-json`
#     to `gn gen`, which generates an up-to-date
#     `$root_build_dir/project.json` file, used here as input.
#
#  2) Add this target to the host_labels list to ensure its action script is
#     run by "fx build".
#
# For more details, see docs/development/language/rust/README.md
#
# Notes on transitioning this target from `base_package_labels` to `host_tools`:
#
#  1) Existing `args.gn` files created by `fx set --cargo-toml-gen` will have
#     added the target to the `base_package_labels` list.  This list assumes the
#     default toolchain.
#  2) `base_package_labels` currently feeds into
#       - `//:developer_base_package_labels`
#  3) New `args.gn` files created by `fx set --cargo-toml-gen` will instead use
#     the `host_labels` arg (which assumes the host toolchain).  That list is
#     currently being used with the `//:host` group, but it's being split into
#       - `//build/input/product:host_labels`
#       - `//build/input/board:host_labels`
#       - `//:host` will remain for developer-specified host tools to include in
#         the build.
#   4) Developers _may_ have added `//build/rust:cargo_toml_gen` to either of
#      following:
#        - `cache_package_labels` (`//:developer_cache_packages`)
#        - `universe_package_labels` (`//:developer_universe_packages`)
#      and those are being split as well, and so the following groups will need
#      to be added to visibility:
#        - `//:developer_cache_packages`
#        - `//:developer_universe_packages`
