This test verifies that a GN bazel_action() target can invoke a Bazel build
command, passing a bazel_input_resource_directory() as input.

- `list_directory.bzl` implements a custom Bazel rule that takes
  a filegroup() label as input, and will list all the source files
  it points to in an output file.

- This is used by the `list_directory` target in `BUILD.bazel`,
  which uses the `@legacy_ninja_build_outputs//:03_input_resource_directory'
  filegroup() label, and uses the `files.txt` output file name.

- This filegroup is created from a GN `bazel_input_resource_directory()`
  target defined in BUILD.gn, which points to a directory whose
  content is generated by a custom GN action (i.e. GN doesn't know
  anything about the files in the directory itself).

- The `test` target invokes bazel_action() to build the Bazel target,
  passing the generated directory through `bazel_inputs`, and copies
  back the final output file as `ninja.files.txt`.
