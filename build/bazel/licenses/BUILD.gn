#
# Warnings:
# (1) license_data dependency above is VERY SLOW.
# (2) When developing locally, since license_data may produce inaccurate
#     results if you didn't 'fx clean'. If you want to avoid 'fx clean' do:
#     * fxbug.dev/84924 workaround: Manually delete the SPDX output :
#       `rm -rf out/default/obj/build/bazel/licenses/licenses_data/`
#     * fxbug.dev/117694 workaround: Manually delete cached depenedncy calculation:
#       `rm out/default/project.json`
