    # remote builds).
    #
    # Another benefit is that we can symlink the prebuilt clang directory
    # in our @prebuilt_clang repository now. This does not work with -MD because
    # the path generated by the compiler for dependencies are fully resolved
    # and would not match the content of cxx_builtin_include_directories,
