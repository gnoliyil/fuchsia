Usage: $PROGNAME [options] SOURCE DESTINATION

Copy SOURCE into DESTINATION as efficiently as possible while preserving
mtime with the highest accuracy possible (some platform copy commands
truncate the mtime, e.g. on OS X, the nanoseconds are truncated to
microseconds).

Valid options:
  --help               Print this message.
  --python-exe=PYTHON  Path to Python interpreter to use, required on OS X.
