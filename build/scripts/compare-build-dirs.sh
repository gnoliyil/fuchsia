function usage() {

usage: $0 DIR1 DIR2 [RELPATH]

Compares two build directories for artifact differences.
Comparison logic tries to account for the file type in
choosing a diff strategy.

If RELPATH is provided, then compare DIR1/RELPATH vs. DIR2/RELPATH.
The joined path may reference a directory or file.

Run this from the Fuchsia source checkout root dir ($FUCHSIA_DIR),
because it references some tools from the source tree.

Example: Compare two clean builds with same output dir:
  fx set ...
  fx clean-build
  cp -p -r out/default out/default.bkp
  fx clean-build
  cp -p -r out/default out/default.bkp2
  $0 out/default.bkp out/default.bkp2
