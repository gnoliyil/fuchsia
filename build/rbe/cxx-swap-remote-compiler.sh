This wrapper script rewrites and executes a remote compilation commmand.
This script allows a command to use host platform tools locally while
using different platform binaries remotely.
This script itself is only intended to be run in a remote environment.

Responsibility for uploading remote platform tools lies outside of this script.

Pass this script as: rewrapper --remote_wrapper=$script
